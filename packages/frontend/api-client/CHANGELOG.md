# @oppenheimer/api-client

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 951a622: `GET /v1/access-grants` is paginated, and the scope resolver's grant lookup is
  one statement shape.

  - **Breaking response shape:** `GET /v1/access-grants` returned every grant in
    the organization as a bare array. It now takes `page` and `limit` (default
    20, at most 100) and answers `{ data, meta }` like the other paginated lists
    (`PaginatedAccessGrantsResponseDto`), newest first. No first-party client
    called it; an API-token script reading the array needs to read `data` and
    follow `meta.totalPages`.
  - `findActiveForPrincipals` passes the principals as two arrays through
    `unnest`, so the SQL text no longer changes with how many teams and roles a
    user has (one plan-cache and `pg_stat_statements` entry), and it still reads
    through `IDX_access_grant_lookup`.

- a0e23bd: The package exports `heyApiSdk`, its types and `applyApiClientConfig` only; the legacy `*Api` classes and the query helpers are gone, and SDK functions take the API's operation names.
- 604707a: Automations: the API gains the `automations` and `inbound-events` modules, shared gains the trigger catalog and schemas, and the client is regenerated.
- 64d3f7a: Remove the Stripe `billing` module and the `leads` example the project
  inherited from the Flama starter. Neither was ever composed into the API, so no
  endpoint a deployment served goes away; what goes is everything that existed
  only for them. Stripe billing can be brought back from the Flama starter's
  `billing` plugin, then `pnpm generate:api-client`.

  These are breaking changes for anything that imported the removed names, which
  is why the packages below take a minor bump while they are on 0.x.

  - `@oppenheimer/api` drops `src/billing`, `src/leads`, the `stripe` config and
    the `stripe` dependency, and the `stripe_billing` capability (and with it the
    property on `GET /health/capabilities`). The `lead`, `subscription` and
    `billing_customer` tables, which nothing ever wrote, are gone from the
    schema. The `STRIPE_*`
    variables leave `.env.example`.
  - `@oppenheimer/shared` drops the `billing` and `leads` scope resources and
    permission groups (so the `billing:*` and `leads:*` scopes), the
    `stripe_billing` deployment and client capability, the `Billing` subject, the
    `GET /billing/subscriptions` endpoint policy and the billing and lead schemas.
  - `@oppenheimer/api-client` drops the legacy `BillingApi` and `LeadsApi`
    services and their models, and the regenerated types no longer carry the
    removed scopes or `stripe_billing`.
  - `@oppenheimer/translations` drops the `BILLING_*` and `LEAD_*` error copy and
    the unused billing entry of the team page's permission areas.
  - `@oppenheimer/backend-core`: the capabilities registry's docs no longer use
    Stripe as their example.

- f099524: Add `HealthApi.deploymentCapabilities()`.
- a880b19: Connecting a host is hardened. An unpaired host is refused a link and stops dialling. The pairing-token cap holds under concurrent mints, and `POST /v1/hosts/pairing` takes `replaces` to retire the token on screen in the same write. The owner is emailed when a machine pairs. The agent prompt is a short template around the install command. `runner uninstall --force` keeps the pairing when a session cannot be ended, and a re-run of the installer restarts the systemd unit on the new release.
- 09cea4c: Effort is each CLI's own levels, per model, instead of five product stops.

  - `@oppenheimer/shared`: each model lists its effort levels and default, each agent spells a level once, and `effortLevelFor` decides what may be recorded.
  - `@oppenheimer/runner`: launch effort is keyed by model and dropped when the model lacks it or the saved launch predates levels.
  - `@oppenheimer/api` / `@oppenheimer/api-client`: sessions, their log and automation revisions record only a level their model offers.
  - `@oppenheimer/web` / `@oppenheimer/translations`: the slider draws the model's levels and sends nothing until moved.
  - `@oppenheimer/design-system-web`: `EffortSlider` and `EffortPicker` take their stops from the caller; `EFFORT_STOPS` is gone.

- fc0e75d: The hosts backend for the Settings page (`product/versions/mvp/14-hosts-settings.md`).

  - `@oppenheimer/api`: a host read carries a derived `status` (`running`, `idle`,
    `offline`, `unpaired`) and `runningSessionCount`, counted by `sessions/`
    through `HostsModule.contributeUsage`. `GET /v1/hosts` leaves unpaired hosts
    out unless `include=unpaired`. Removing a host, from either end, stops the
    sessions running on it. New `GET /v1/hosts/pairing/{id}` returns the token and
    the host it paired, for Add host's "Listening for this host…".
  - `@oppenheimer/shared`: `HOST_STATUSES`, `listHostsQuerySchema`, and an
    optional `cpus` on the host facts, on both Zod entry points.
  - `@oppenheimer/api-client`: regenerated; `getPairingToken`,
    `PairingTokenStatusResponseDto`, `HostStatus`.
  - `@oppenheimer/runner`: the facts report the logical CPU count as `cpus`.
  - `@oppenheimer/api`: host metadata tables (`host_inventory`, `host_presence`,
    `host_network`, `host_event`), backfilled from `host`; the old columns stay
    until the code switches over (`product/versions/mvp/15-host-metadata.md`).
  - `@oppenheimer/api`: heartbeats write `host_presence` and, only when the
    machine changed, `host_inventory`, with the change on the host's timeline;
    host responses carry `machine`, `vitals` and `network`;
    `GET /v1/hosts/{id}/timeline`. The network a runner connects from is
    recorded and placed with DB-IP Lite (`HOSTS_GEOIP_CITY_DB`,
    `HOSTS_GEOIP_ASN_DB`, the `ip_geolocation` capability); a move to another
    country or network operator emails the owner. A daily job purges networks
    unseen for 90 days and timeline entries past 180.
  - `@oppenheimer/runner`: reports OS name, kernel, CPU model, memory, disk
    total, virtualization, cloud, time zone, boot time and service manager,
    and available memory on the heartbeat.
  - `@oppenheimer/backend-email`: `sendHostNetworkChanged` and its template.
  - `@oppenheimer/translations`: `emails.hostNetworkChanged`.

- 1a51afc: Generate the client with hey-api.
- 5bd4a8b: New session sets how a session is launched, and `POST /sessions` takes it.

  The route grows a `launch` object — model, permission level, effort — and the
  `prompt` typed into the composer. The launch is folded onto `work_session` so a
  restart can relaunch a session the way it was launched without walking its log.
  The prompt is a log entry and rides `session.create` to the host, where it
  becomes the agent's trailing argument rather than something typed at a running
  terminal — so nothing about the composer waits on the relay, and exactly one of
  the two ends ever writes `prompt.first`. It also names the session, through a
  new `openai-compatible` namer provider that covers Groq, Together, vLLM and a
  local Ollama.

  The agent catalog in `@oppenheimer/shared` grows each agent's models and the
  argv its permission levels, effort stops and first task map to, read off
  claude 2.1.278's and codex-cli 0.155.1's own `--help`.

  **Breaking, `@oppenheimer/frontend-consumer`:** `SessionEntity` was modelling one
  repository, one branch and a `running | idle | stopped` state the control plane
  had stopped sending. It carries `checkouts`, the derived `state` group and the
  stored `lifecycle` now, and `create` takes an idempotency key from its caller.

- 173bb4c: Projects are a saved scope a person creates, and metadata only. `POST /projects` takes a name, the repositories (replaced as a set on `PATCH`, each with a base branch and a default flag) and a default host and agent; the slug comes from the name and never changes. Nothing is derived from a repository any more: `originGithubRepoId` is gone, and a session that names no project is listed in the workspace's **Unassigned** project, which every workspace has and which cannot be renamed or archived (`PROJECTS_008`). `POST /sessions/{id}/move` lists a session under any active project without anything moving on the host: the layout has no project level and a session's branch is `oppenheimer/<session>`. `session.create` no longer carries `projectSlug`. `GET /sessions` gains `githubRepoId`, `agent` and `sort`. The console's New project is a page (`/projects/new`) that returns to New session on the project it made; the project chip starts on Unassigned, and each sidebar row gains a Move to project menu. The translations gain a `projects` namespace. `PROJECTS_004` and `SESSIONS_009` are no longer raised.
- f099524: Regenerated: the problem-document schema now reaches the generated client.
- f099524: Regenerated against the tightened user endpoints.
- 8fab63d: Add server-evaluated feature flags, wired into the API and the console.

  Flags are declared in code, targeted in the database, evaluated on the server
  and read on every client from one endpoint — the shape Stripe and Revolut
  describe for their own. Ported from the Flama starter.

  - **`@oppenheimer/shared`** gains `feature-flags/`: the `FEATURE_FLAGS` catalog
    (every flag the code may read, with its kind, owner, safe default and — for
    temporary flags — expiry), the pure evaluator (ordered rules, segments,
    semver targeting on the app build, deterministic MurmurHash3 percentage
    splits bucketed by organization), and the Zod schemas for targeting writes.
    Like `agents` and `protocol` it is reached through its own subpaths, not the
    root barrel: `@oppenheimer/shared/feature-flags`, and the Zod-free
    `@oppenheimer/shared/feature-flags/catalog` for the web bundle. A `flags`
    scope group, a `FeatureFlag` subject and a `GET /feature-flags/admin`
    endpoint policy join the catalogs.
  - **`@oppenheimer/api`** gains a `feature-flags` module. Every replica holds
    all targeting in memory and evaluates without I/O, polling a cheap
    fingerprint to stay in sync and keeping its last good snapshot through a
    database blip. `GET /v1/feature-flags` serves the caller's evaluated client
    flags (signed out too); the endpoints under `/v1/feature-flags/admin`,
    `/segments` and `/changes` edit targeting, pull kill switches, manage
    segments, explain an evaluation and read the audit trail, which every change
    lands on through the outbox. `@RequireFlag('key')` gates a route on a flag,
    and token creation is now behind the `api_token_creation` kill switch. New
    error codes `FLAG_001`–`FLAG_007`. Migration `AddFeatureFlags`, every point
    in time `timestamptz`.
  - **`@oppenheimer/api-client`**: the regenerated client carries the feature
    flag operations and DTOs.
  - **`@oppenheimer/frontend-core`**: a `feature-flags` kernel module and
    `useFeatureFlag` / `useFeatureFlagValue` / `useFeatureFlags`, typed by the
    catalog, reading the API rather than PostHog. Flags are prefetched as soon as
    the session is known, persisted with the query cache, and an `experiment`
    flag records a `feature_flag_exposed` event. `OppenheimerApp.create` takes
    `featureFlags: { platform, appVersion }`.

    **Breaking:** feature flags leave the analytics port. `IAnalyticsClient` no
    longer has `getFeatureFlags` / `onFeatureFlags`, `AnalyticsService` no longer
    serves flags, `analyticsKeys.flags` is gone, and `isFlagEnabled` moved to the
    `feature-flags` module. `useFeatureFlag(key)` keeps its name but now takes a
    catalog key and reads the server's answer.

  - **`@oppenheimer/frontend-web`**: the PostHog adapter drops its flag methods
    and switches PostHog's own flag loading off.
  - **`@oppenheimer/translations`**: messages for `FLAG_001`–`FLAG_007`, and the
    control-plane copy for a flags screen (`control.flags`, `nav.featureFlags`).
  - **`@oppenheimer/web`** reports its platform and build when it asks for its
    flags.

  `pnpm check:flags` (in CI) fails on a temporary flag past its expiry date and
  on a flag the catalog declares but no code reads.

- ca05d90: Cheaper runner-link traffic and a keyset session list.

  - `@oppenheimer/api`: a batch of session events lands in one `INSERT` (the
    `MAX(seq)` read still runs after the row lock, in its own statement), and the
    runner's append no longer reads the session before its transaction
    (`appendEventsForHost`). A link's queued `events.append` batches for one
    session are coalesced into one append and acknowledged per `batchId`. The
    queue is bounded: the socket is paused at 64 waiting batches, resumed at 16,
    and closed with 1013 at 256 or after a 10 s pause; the keepalive does not
    terminate a link it paused. Runner frames are capped at 512 KiB by `ws`
    itself (1009). A heartbeat is one statement when the inventory is unchanged:
    `recordVitalsIfPaired` replaces `recordVitals` and the host-row read.
    `GET /v1/sessions` takes an opaque `cursor` and answers `meta.nextCursor`;
    page mode is unchanged apart from `recent`'s id tie-break now running
    descending.
  - `@oppenheimer/shared`: `listSessionsQuerySchema` takes an optional `cursor`.
  - `@oppenheimer/api-client`: regenerated — `cursor` on `listSessions`,
    `nextCursor` on `SessionPageMetaDto`, whose counts are now optional.
  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-consumer`: `SessionsRepository.findAll` walks the list
    by cursor instead of by page and count.

- f101364: Regenerated from the OpenAPI document: the eleven session operations, the archive
  operation on projects, and the session, checkout, event and attach-ticket
  response types.
- f099524: Scope arrays carry the `SCOPES` union, the permission catalog carries real DTOs and `GET /v1/users` carries `PaginatedUsersResponseDto` — previously `string[]`, `Record<string, any>[]` and `any`.

### Patch Changes

- 2063d42: A rate-limited request answers `RATE_001` with a `retryAfter` member instead of a codeless 429. `POST /v1/access-grants` returns the grant it created, instead of falling back to another grant in the organization.
- f099524: Regenerated: the documented 401/403 failures now reach the OpenAPI document.
- 669b0d3: Let one generator own every DTO name: `src/common/models/*` now re-exports the hey-api type of the same name instead of holding a second, rotting definition of it.
- 9ed9703: Regenerate against the widened scope enum, so `CreateApiTokenRequest.scopes` accepts the control plane's scopes.
- 1094480: Creating a role no longer falls back to a global role for any caller when the
  request has no organization. `POST /v1/roles` without an active organization
  still creates a global role for a platform admin (`manage all`), and answers
  `ROLE_008` (400) for anyone else instead of writing a role every tenant reads.
  The command must set `CreateRoleCommand.global` explicitly, and the handler
  checks `manage all` again before creating the role. Adds the `ROLE_008`
  message in both locales.
- 7ed4e17: The GitHub App install callback is bound to the person who started it.

  - `@oppenheimer/api`: `POST /v1/installations/install-state` (`startInstallation`)
    mints a single-use, 15-minute state bound to the caller and the workspace and
    answers the App's install URL carrying it. `POST /v1/installations` requires
    that state and spends it before GitHub is called; anything else is
    `GITHUB_011`, one code for missing, expired, reused and someone else's.
  - `@oppenheimer/shared`: `connectInstallationSchema` requires `state`
    (`installStateSchema`).
  - `@oppenheimer/api-client`: regenerated.
  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-consumer`: `useStartInstallation`, and
    `InstallationsService.connect` takes `{ githubInstallationId, code, state }`.
  - `@oppenheimer/web`: Connect GitHub and New session's Manage repository access
    mint the state on click; a callback without one is refused on screen and
    never posted. The first-run walk rides as the state's prefix.
  - `@oppenheimer/translations`: `errors.byCode.GITHUB_011`,
    `onboarding.flow.github.unstarted`, `onboarding.flow.github.starting`,
    `sessions.new.repository.manageFailed`.

- 79e30e5: Regenerate against the installation endpoints: connect, disconnect, list, and the live repository and branch listings.
- 8e2de68: Regenerate for the host routes: pairing tokens, registration and the host's own
  uninstall call.
- a7aa829: `GET /v1/organizations/:orgId/members/me` answers for the organization in the path (`getMembership({ path: { orgId } })`); the unused legacy `OrganizationMembersApi` class is removed.
- 2701a0c: Regenerate from the OpenAPI document: `listProjects`, `getProject`, `updateProject` and `ProjectResponseDto`.
- 024f31b: User and role search match `%` and `_` literally.

  - Added `likeContains(term)` to `@oppenheimer/backend-core`: an `ILIKE`
    contains-pattern with the term's `%`, `_` and `\` escaped.
  - `GET /v1/users?search=` and `GET /v1/roles?search=` use it, so `a_b` no
    longer matches `axb` and `%` no longer matches every row. `search` is trimmed
    and capped at 100 characters (documented as `maxLength` in the OpenAPI
    document; a longer term is a 400).

- 064c443: `POST /sessions` takes exactly one checkout. A session with none was accepted,
  then refused by the runner at launch, which makes a session as one worktree of
  one repository; it is now refused with a 400 before a row is written.
  `CreateSessionInput.checkouts` is a one-element tuple to match.
- 1a51afc: Declare `sideEffects`.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- e209380: Add a CLI and an MCP server, both governed by granular per-credential
  permissions.

  Authorization gains a second layer. Roles say what a _person_ may do; **scopes**
  say what a _credential_ may do on their behalf, and the two are intersected on
  every request. A token can never be minted with more reach than its creator
  has, and revoking someone's role immediately narrows every credential they
  issued.

  - **`@oppenheimer/shared`**: the scope catalog — nine permission groups
    (profile, users, admin, roles, organizations, members, invitations,
    workspaces, tokens), each with a Read and an Edit level backed by the CASL
    rules it authorizes. Helpers for parsing, the write ⇒ read implication, the
    OAuth string form, and `grantableScopes`/`ungrantableScopes`, which enforce
    the "never exceed your creator" rule. Plus `ResourceScope` for per-organization
    narrowing, Zod schemas for token creation, and an `ApiToken` subject with
    own-token permissions on the seeded `user` role.

  - **`@oppenheimer/api`**: a new `api-tokens` DDD module (Better Auth 1.6 no longer
    ships an apiKey plugin). Only a SHA-256 digest of each secret is stored;
    tokens support expiry, IP allowlists and organization scoping, and are revoked
    rather than deleted. `ApiAuthGuard` replaces Better Auth's cookie-only guard
    and accepts a session cookie, an API token or an OAuth access token;
    `ScopesGuard` is registered globally and fails closed, so a route that
    declares no `@RequireScopes` cannot be reached by a token at all. The MCP
    plugin adds OAuth 2.1 discovery, dynamic client registration and a consent
    page. New endpoints: `GET|POST /v1/tokens`, `DELETE /v1/tokens/:id`,
    `GET /v1/tokens/permissions` and `GET /v1/me/credential`.

  - **`@oppenheimer/mcp`** (new): an MCP server exposing 26 tools over stdio and
    Streamable HTTP from one registry. Tools declare the scopes they need and the
    tool list is filtered by the credential's effective scopes, so an agent is
    never shown a capability that would be refused.

  - **`@oppenheimer/cli`** (new): `oppenheimer` — login that trades a session for a scoped
    token, token management with a permission catalog, users/roles/orgs/workspaces
    commands, `--json` output, profiles, and `oppenheimer mcp install` to connect an
    agent.

  Deploying runs a migration that adds the `api_token` and OAuth tables and grants
  every user permission over their own tokens. `pnpm generate:api-client` no
  longer needs a running database.
