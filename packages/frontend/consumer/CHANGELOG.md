# @oppenheimer/frontend-consumer

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 5bd4a8b: New session sets how a session is launched, and `POST /sessions` takes it.

  The route grows a `launch` object — model, permission level, effort — and the
  `prompt` typed into the composer. The launch is folded onto `work_session` so a
  restart can relaunch a session the way it was launched without walking its log.
  The prompt is a log entry and rides `session.create` to the host, where it
  becomes the agent's trailing argument rather than something typed at a running
  terminal — so nothing about the composer waits on the relay, and exactly one of
  the two ends ever writes `prompt.first`. It also names the session, through a
  new `openai-compatible` namer provider that covers Groq, Together, vLLM and a
  local Ollama.

  The agent catalog in `@oppenheimer/shared` grows each agent's models and the
  argv its permission levels, effort stops and first task map to, read off
  claude 2.1.278's and codex-cli 0.155.1's own `--help`.

  **Breaking, `@oppenheimer/frontend-consumer`:** `SessionEntity` was modelling one
  repository, one branch and a `running | idle | stopped` state the control plane
  had stopped sending. It carries `checkouts`, the derived `state` group and the
  stored `lifecycle` now, and `create` takes an idempotency key from its caller.

### Minor Changes

- 24d217d: Add host is a dialog in the console.

  - `@oppenheimer/web`: New session's host chip opens the Add host dialog instead
    of navigating to `/onboarding/host`; the dialog owns the Command / Agent
    prompt switch, the panel and a footer that arms on a registered host.
  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-web`: new `hosts` concern with `HostPairingChrome` —
    the token line and the status row the onboarding step and the dialog both
    draw.
  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-consumer`: `useHostPairing` (in `react/hosts.pairing.ts`)
    is the pairing flow both surfaces run; it counts `secondsLeft` rather than
    formatting a clock. `useCurrentPairing`, `usePairingTokens` and `useHosts`'s
    poll are its internals and leave the barrel; the unused `usePairHost` is gone.
  - `@oppenheimer/translations`: new `hosts` namespace for the pairing copy both
    surfaces read, `sessions.new.addHost.*` for the dialog's own words, and
    `common.close`.

- db7d2f7: `frontend-consumer` gains an `automations` module and its query hooks.
- f099524: The organizations repository no longer swallows a failed read into an empty list.
- a880b19: Connecting a host is hardened. An unpaired host is refused a link and stops dialling. The pairing-token cap holds under concurrent mints, and `POST /v1/hosts/pairing` takes `replaces` to retire the token on screen in the same write. The owner is emailed when a machine pairs. The agent prompt is a short template around the install command. `runner uninstall --force` keeps the pairing when a session cannot be ended, and a re-run of the installer restarts the systemd unit on the new release.
- a0e23bd: Pass-through services are removed (`app.<module>` is the repository); `useHostPresence` and `refetchEverythingForNewIdentity` are added.
- bb3c4e8: `useSessionStartProgress` reads how a session's start is going: the steps its host reported, and the host's reason when it failed.
- ba9abd0: Timing and retry decisions move to `CORE_CONFIG`
  (`@oppenheimer/frontend-core/config`) and `CONSUMER_CONFIG`
  (`@oppenheimer/frontend-consumer/config`); `createQueryClient`'s `staleTime`
  now defaults to the kernel's. Values are unchanged.
- ab97201: Unused code is removed, and each barrel exports only what the console imports; `pnpm check:unused` holds it there.
- c078d0d: `GET /health/capabilities` reports `hosts`, and the console's pairing surfaces mint no token when it is false.
- e717f42: Harden the runner link. PTY bytes are no longer dropped when a queue fills,
  and the runner's writer sends control frames first, then takes attachments in
  turn, so one pane's output no longer delays another pane's echo. Both sides
  now ping every 15 s, a runner the control plane cannot write to is closed
  rather than skipped, and epochs keep rising across API restarts. The
  terminal's transport (`SessionStream`, the resize coalescer, the replay
  stream) moves from `apps/web` into `@oppenheimer/frontend-consumer`, behind
  `SessionsService.openStream` and `useSessionStream`.
- 2202daa: A session's first task can carry images.

  - `@oppenheimer/shared`: `session.create` carries `images` for runners that name `session.create.images`; `POST /sessions` takes `attachmentIds`.
  - `@oppenheimer/api`: `POST /v1/sessions/attachments` stages an image for the create that names it.
  - `@oppenheimer/runner`: pulls a create's images and names their paths to the agent with the task.
  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-consumer`: `useUploadSessionAttachment`.
  - `@oppenheimer/web`, `@oppenheimer/translations`: the paperclip and paste attach images to the first task.

- d5d310c: An organization's repositories can be reached from the project dialog, and a requested organization install is said rather than dropped.
- f099524: Name the product's own non-persisted queries: `CONSUMER_NON_PERSISTED_FEATURES` adds `sessions`, `hosts`, `apiTokens` and `profile`.
- 2dc27d2: Plan: a task board, goals and a calendar, the console rail's third item
  (`product/versions/mvp/17-plan.md`).

  - `@oppenheimer/api`: the `tasks` module (tasks, goals, the board's order,
    starting or linking a session, the attach rule) and the `calendar` module
    (personal events, read-only Google Calendar through a port, the sealed
    refresh token under `CALENDAR_TOKEN_KEY`), with the `google_calendar`
    capability, two migrations and the `Task` and `Calendar` rules on `owner`.
  - `@oppenheimer/web`: `/plan` (the board and its dialogs), `/plan/calendar`
    (the month and its layers) and `/plan/calendar/google` (Google's return),
    the Plan rail item, and "Back to task" in a session's status bar.
  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-consumer`: the `tasks` and `calendar` modules and
    their query hooks; `toCreateSessionRequest` is shared by both start paths.
  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-web`: `DateField`, `TimeField` and calendar-day
    helpers in the `i18n` concern.
  - `@oppenheimer/api-client`: regenerated for the new routes.
  - `@oppenheimer/shared`: the task, goal and calendar schemas, the `tasks` and
    `calendar` scopes and the `Task` and `Calendar` subjects.
  - `@oppenheimer/translations`: the `tasks` and `calendar` namespaces,
    `nav.plan`, the date and time field copy and the new toasts.

- e505b9e: A host gets the repository ready while New session is still being written:
  picking a host and a repository sends `repository.prepare`
  (`POST /v1/sessions/prepare`), and the host clones or fetches it and builds a
  spare worktree, so the create that follows starts in about a second. A first
  clone is shallow and deepened in the background, checkouts write from one
  worker per core, and session branches are cut `--no-track`.
- 0918701: `useChangeEmail` and `useDeleteAccount`; the profile repository goes through the generated SDK alone.
- 173bb4c: Projects are a saved scope a person creates, and metadata only. `POST /projects` takes a name, the repositories (replaced as a set on `PATCH`, each with a base branch and a default flag) and a default host and agent; the slug comes from the name and never changes. Nothing is derived from a repository any more: `originGithubRepoId` is gone, and a session that names no project is listed in the workspace's **Unassigned** project, which every workspace has and which cannot be renamed or archived (`PROJECTS_008`). `POST /sessions/{id}/move` lists a session under any active project without anything moving on the host: the layout has no project level and a session's branch is `oppenheimer/<session>`. `session.create` no longer carries `projectSlug`. `GET /sessions` gains `githubRepoId`, `agent` and `sort`. The console's New project is a page (`/projects/new`) that returns to New session on the project it made; the project chip starts on Unassigned, and each sidebar row gains a Move to project menu. The translations gain a `projects` namespace. `PROJECTS_004` and `SESSIONS_009` are no longer raised.
- cefbc53: Pull requests: a queue of the watched repositories' open pull requests read live from GitHub (Mine, Review requests, Watching), each in a rule-based lane with what holds it; a briefing with the path to merge, the description, the diff with line comments, and a review that approves and merges in the user's own name; watched repositories; and analytics of the review period against the one before.
- bfa1020: `installationsKeys` gains `detail`, `repositoryList` and `repository`; `repositories(id)` is now a scope, and branches are keyed `[..., 'repositories', 'detail', repoId, 'branches']`. Hosts pairing keys are `hostsKeys.pairingTokens()` (`['hosts', 'pairing', 'tokens']`, was `pairings()`) and `currentPairing(name)` (`[..., 'current', { name }]`). `useSession`, `useSessionStartProgress`, `useCheckSlug` and the installation pickers take `undefined` for an input that isn't known yet and fetch with `skipToken`. `useRegister` also invalidates `profileKeys.me()`. Mutation hooks go through `withCacheOnSuccess`.
- bbacd49: Build the runner ↔ control-plane link so a session can be created and run from the console.

  - API: `relay/` mounts the two sockets of the protocol on the API's own HTTP server — the runner link (`GET /api/v1/relay/runner`, boot assertion as bearer, hello/welcome, heartbeat → host presence, `events.append` → the session log, acked by key) and the browser attach socket (`GET /api/v1/relay/attach`, single-use ticket as the subprotocol, re-checked against the session and the workspace membership). `links/` holds the per-host link registry and the real `SessionDispatchPort`, replacing the pending adapter.
  - Runner: `internal/link` dials out with a per-dial EdDSA boot token, pins the control plane's key fingerprint from `welcome`, reconnects through the ladder with an epoch, streams PTY reads as attachment-id-prefixed frames and reports events with `<runId>:<n>` keys, resending what was not acked. `session.create` maps the structured launch onto the agent's argv through the catalog mirror; the sessions service gained `Stop` and a caller-provided id.
  - Web: `SessionStream` is the real transport over the attach socket, minting a fresh ticket per (re)connect; the terminal shows `offline` while the host holds no link.
  - Credentials: `credentials.token` is answered with a `credentials.grant` sealed to the host's key (Ed25519 → X25519, ephemeral ECDH, HKDF, AES-256-GCM); the runner's git credential helper pulls the token over the link, unseals it and holds it in memory until expiry or `credentials.revoke`. Hello reconciliation re-dispatches a launch the host never carried out and records stopped a session it lost. `attachment.credit` pauses PTY reads at 256 KB in flight; `host.preflight` and `host.update` are handled.
  - Shared: the protocol gains `welcome`, `session.stop`, `session.detach`, `command.failed`, `attachment.closed` and the attach socket's own vocabulary; `CacheService` gains `take()` (`GETDEL`).

- a566fac: A session's start says when the host is downloading the repository for the
  first time: the clone step carries `download`, and the start pane explains
  the longer wait.
- 064c443: `POST /sessions` takes exactly one checkout. A session with none was accepted,
  then refused by the runner at launch, which makes a session as one worktree of
  one repository; it is now refused with a 400 before a row is written.
  `CreateSessionInput.checkouts` is a one-element tuple to match.
- f023fd9: Opening a session from the list renders the row the cache already holds instead of waiting on a second read.
- c2288fb: A new session opens on its agent. The runner starts the agent in place of the
  pane's shell (`tmux respawn-pane`) instead of typing the line that starts it,
  and the console keeps the start's steps on screen until the agent step lands.
- 3404cd3: A session's terminal can be shared with a link, to watch or to type, for anyone, any signed-in account or named people (`product/versions/mvp/21-session-share-links.md`).
- 3e6e3dc: Settings → Hosts, as `design/version1/Settings.dc.html` draws it: a page in its own frame, reached from the account menu, listing the workspace's hosts as cards (status, running sessions, OS · vCPU · runner version, connected or last seen) with inline rename, copy ID and remove, and Add a host opening inside the same frame. `HostCard`, `SettingsNav`, `PageHeader`, `RoutineSteps` and the tabbed `CodeBlock` panel now measure as the version-1 export does.
- c237a5f: The console's sidebar reorders by dragging: a project by its header among
  the others (`SortableSidebarProjectGroup`), and a session within its project
  or into another one, which moves it there. The order is kept on the device,
  and the sort menu gains Custom order, its new default.
  `useSortableGroups` tells `onChange` when a drag settles and hands `onMove`
  the value it settled on; a session write stays pending until the session
  lists have refetched.
- b336aae: The polls the workspace event stream covers stand down while it is live: every package poll goes through `usePollWhile(kind, queryKey, active)`, and one coverage table in `workspace-events.ts` says which keys stand down (sessions, their start steps, a pending pairing token) and which only catch up (presence, automation runs); they poll again the moment the stream drops. The API ends every stream on a replica whose Redis subscriber connection closes, so a console is never live and deaf, and the console refetches what the stream covers each time it comes up, the first connect included.
- 0e5fd26: A session's terminal says what to do when its host is offline, and redials
  when the host is back.

  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-consumer`: `useHostPresence` takes `watching` (polls
    only while it holds) and `select`, so a pane can watch one host on the same
    `hostPresence` poll Settings → Hosts uses.
  - `@oppenheimer/web`: `useTerminal` takes `hostId`; while the link is offline
    it watches that host and redials once a poll answered after the drop finds it
    online. The band under the terminal is the design system's
    `HostLinkChrome`: a banner while the host is away (offline, catching up,
    reconnected) with the time offline and How to fix, which opens the commands
    to copy and the link to Settings → Hosts. Retry now is offered only for a
    blip.
  - `@oppenheimer/translations`: `sessions.session.hostLink.*`; the stream's
    status words other than `closed` go.

- f099524: The api-tokens repository drops the casts the loose types forced, including a `dto as never` that was disabling type checking on the create-token body.

### Patch Changes

- edfe29d: A poll that watches something finish (a session start, a run, a pairing)
  keeps running while the tab is hidden. `LIVE_POLL` now owns that with the
  interval, and a hook spreads `pollWhile()`.
- 8875e5b: Deleting an automation from its own page goes back to the list, with the toast
  that says it was deleted, instead of leaving the browser on the page of an
  automation that no longer exists.
- 4c4db57: A deleted session leaves the sidebar once its host has closed it.
- 7ed4e17: The GitHub App install callback is bound to the person who started it.

  - `@oppenheimer/api`: `POST /v1/installations/install-state` (`startInstallation`)
    mints a single-use, 15-minute state bound to the caller and the workspace and
    answers the App's install URL carrying it. `POST /v1/installations` requires
    that state and spends it before GitHub is called; anything else is
    `GITHUB_011`, one code for missing, expired, reused and someone else's.
  - `@oppenheimer/shared`: `connectInstallationSchema` requires `state`
    (`installStateSchema`).
  - `@oppenheimer/api-client`: regenerated.
  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-consumer`: `useStartInstallation`, and
    `InstallationsService.connect` takes `{ githubInstallationId, code, state }`.
  - `@oppenheimer/web`: Connect GitHub and New session's Manage repository access
    mint the state on click; a callback without one is refused on screen and
    never posted. The first-run walk rides as the state's prefix.
  - `@oppenheimer/translations`: `errors.byCode.GITHUB_011`,
    `onboarding.flow.github.unstarted`, `onboarding.flow.github.starting`,
    `sessions.new.repository.manageFailed`.

- 9a8fb1b: A session that is still starting is read again every two seconds until the host has opened it, so New session lands on the terminal without a reload.
- 2d84b28: Pull requests read GitHub under its limits and survive a refused part. Each token keeps at most four requests in flight and waits out `Retry-After` and a spent budget, and a long wait is `GITHUB_015` instead of `GITHUB_009` (#247). Analytics reads at most the 150 most recently closed pull requests and says so when there were more. A pull request whose checks GitHub refuses keeps its row with "Checks unavailable", a repository GitHub will not answer is named instead of failing the queue, and a refused permission says what to grant (#244).
- c412130: The Pull requests area reads the repositories you watch, and nothing until you
  watch one. The queue answers with the rows it could fill and fills more over
  the reads that follow, rather than making you wait for every part of every row;
  a pull request it has not read yet is left out instead of shown with a lane and
  a checks state nobody read. Your own pull requests are recognised from a
  personal installation when you have no stored GitHub grant. The review
  period's numbers are kept in the browser's cache, so Analytics draws them at
  once instead of a skeleton, and a quarter's chart is drawn by the week, as the
  artboard draws it. What a read could not show is one notice rather than a
  callout per repository, part and refusal.
- b32d3b8: - `@oppenheimer/frontend-core`: `useQuery` and `useQueries` that share entities across refetches.
  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-consumer`: every query hook goes through them.
  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-web`: `createDialogSlot` replaces `ConsoleDialogProvider`, `useConsoleDialog` and `useConsoleList`; `SidebarSearchField` is added.
  - `@oppenheimer/design-system-web`: `useNow` shares one timer per interval; `FieldSelect` no longer reads a ref in render.
  - `@oppenheimer/web`: fewer re-renders in the sidebars and the project dialog.
- b2fd6a1: A session takes files, not only images: PNG, JPEG, GIF and WebP as before,
  plus PDF and UTF-8 text (plain, Markdown, CSV, JSON, code, logs), pasted,
  dropped or attached to the first task. Every file is judged by its bytes at
  the API and again on the host: executables, archives, scripts with a `#!`
  line, SVG and HTML are refused whatever they are called, and the runner
  names each file itself. A runner announces the wider set with the
  `session.files` capability; an older one is still sent images only.
- ca05d90: Cheaper runner-link traffic and a keyset session list.

  - `@oppenheimer/api`: a batch of session events lands in one `INSERT` (the
    `MAX(seq)` read still runs after the row lock, in its own statement), and the
    runner's append no longer reads the session before its transaction
    (`appendEventsForHost`). A link's queued `events.append` batches for one
    session are coalesced into one append and acknowledged per `batchId`. The
    queue is bounded: the socket is paused at 64 waiting batches, resumed at 16,
    and closed with 1013 at 256 or after a 10 s pause; the keepalive does not
    terminate a link it paused. Runner frames are capped at 512 KiB by `ws`
    itself (1009). A heartbeat is one statement when the inventory is unchanged:
    `recordVitalsIfPaired` replaces `recordVitals` and the host-row read.
    `GET /v1/sessions` takes an opaque `cursor` and answers `meta.nextCursor`;
    page mode is unchanged apart from `recent`'s id tie-break now running
    descending.
  - `@oppenheimer/shared`: `listSessionsQuerySchema` takes an optional `cursor`.
  - `@oppenheimer/api-client`: regenerated — `cursor` on `listSessions`,
    `nextCursor` on `SessionPageMetaDto`, whose counts are now optional.
  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-consumer`: `SessionsRepository.findAll` walks the list
    by cursor instead of by page and count.
