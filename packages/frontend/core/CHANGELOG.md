# @oppenheimer/frontend-core

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- e209380: Add a CLI and an MCP server, both governed by granular per-credential
  permissions.

  Authorization gains a second layer. Roles say what a _person_ may do; **scopes**
  say what a _credential_ may do on their behalf, and the two are intersected on
  every request. A token can never be minted with more reach than its creator
  has, and revoking someone's role immediately narrows every credential they
  issued.

  - **`@oppenheimer/shared`**: the scope catalog — nine permission groups
    (profile, users, admin, roles, organizations, members, invitations,
    workspaces, tokens), each with a Read and an Edit level backed by the CASL
    rules it authorizes. Helpers for parsing, the write ⇒ read implication, the
    OAuth string form, and `grantableScopes`/`ungrantableScopes`, which enforce
    the "never exceed your creator" rule. Plus `ResourceScope` for per-organization
    narrowing, Zod schemas for token creation, and an `ApiToken` subject with
    own-token permissions on the seeded `user` role.

  - **`@oppenheimer/api`**: a new `api-tokens` DDD module (Better Auth 1.6 no longer
    ships an apiKey plugin). Only a SHA-256 digest of each secret is stored;
    tokens support expiry, IP allowlists and organization scoping, and are revoked
    rather than deleted. `ApiAuthGuard` replaces Better Auth's cookie-only guard
    and accepts a session cookie, an API token or an OAuth access token;
    `ScopesGuard` is registered globally and fails closed, so a route that
    declares no `@RequireScopes` cannot be reached by a token at all. The MCP
    plugin adds OAuth 2.1 discovery, dynamic client registration and a consent
    page. New endpoints: `GET|POST /v1/tokens`, `DELETE /v1/tokens/:id`,
    `GET /v1/tokens/permissions` and `GET /v1/me/credential`.

  - **`@oppenheimer/mcp`** (new): an MCP server exposing 26 tools over stdio and
    Streamable HTTP from one registry. Tools declare the scopes they need and the
    tool list is filtered by the credential's effective scopes, so an agent is
    never shown a capability that would be refused.

  - **`@oppenheimer/cli`** (new): `oppenheimer` — login that trades a session for a scoped
    token, token management with a permission catalog, users/roles/orgs/workspaces
    commands, `--json` output, profiles, and `oppenheimer mcp install` to connect an
    agent.


  Deploying runs a migration that adds the `api_token` and OAuth tables and grants
  every user permission over their own tokens. `pnpm generate:api-client` no
  longer needs a running database.

### Patch Changes

- a93cf5d: Refresh dependencies and pin the versions that must move together.

  Every package is updated within its semver range, plus a set of majors that
  carry no API change for this codebase: `@sentry/nestjs` 10, `pino-http` 11,
  `@bull-board/*` 8, `nodemailer` 9, `resend` 6, `inversify` 8,
  `dependency-cruiser` 18, `testcontainers` 12 and `@commitlint/*` 21.

  Three pins are added to `pnpm.overrides`, each for a resolution that the
  update would otherwise get wrong:

  - `react-native` — the mobile design system declares it as an unbounded
    `>=0.81.0` peer with no devDependency, so it re-resolved to 0.86 while both
    Expo apps pin 0.81.5. Two copies of React Native meant two incompatible
    copies of its types, and `@oppenheimer/design-system-mobile` stopped building.
  - `@nestjs/swagger` — 11.4.3 added an `exports` map that no longer exposes
    `dist/services/schema-object-factory`, which `nestjs-zod@4` deep-imports.
    Nothing catches this at build or test time; the API simply fails to boot.
    11.4.2 is the ceiling until the `zod` 4 / `nestjs-zod` 5 migration lands.

  Two unrelated robustness fixes in the auth layer, both found while verifying
  the upgrade against a live stack:

  - The standalone BullMQ email queue had no `error` listener. A queue is an
    EventEmitter, so a Redis restart or failover would raise an unhandled
    `error` event and take the API process down.
  - The `welcome` email enqueue in Better Auth's `user.create.after` hook was
    the only unguarded operation in a hook the surrounding code documents as
    best-effort. Better Auth does not await that hook, so a queue failure
    escaped as an unhandled rejection instead of being logged.

- 68348a6: Surface session-restore failures instead of silently logging the user out.

  Previously a transient network/server error during startup session restore was
  indistinguishable from being genuinely unauthenticated: `getSession()` swallowed
  the error as `null`, `useSessionRestore` ran with `retry: false` and no error
  handling, and both the web and mobile `AuthGate`s only branched on `isLoading` —
  so a single network blip bounced a logged-in user to `/login`.

  - **`@oppenheimer/frontend-core`**: `useSessionRestore` now retries transient failures
    (`retry: 2` with exponential backoff). A genuinely unauthenticated user still
    resolves successfully, so retries only fire on real errors.
  - **web/mobile auth clients**: `getSession()` now throws on transport/server
    errors instead of returning `null`, letting the query distinguish a failed
    lookup from an unauthenticated session.
  - **web/mobile `AuthGate`**: render a "connection problem" screen with a retry
    action on restore failure instead of falling through to `/login`.
  - **`@oppenheimer/translations`**: new `auth.session` strings (en + es).
