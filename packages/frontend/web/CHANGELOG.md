# @oppenheimer/frontend-web

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 24d217d: Add host is a dialog in the console.

  - `@oppenheimer/web`: New session's host chip opens the Add host dialog instead
    of navigating to `/onboarding/host`; the dialog owns the Command / Agent
    prompt switch, the panel and a footer that arms on a registered host.
  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-web`: new `hosts` concern with `HostPairingChrome` —
    the token line and the status row the onboarding step and the dialog both
    draw.
  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-consumer`: `useHostPairing` (in `react/hosts.pairing.ts`)
    is the pairing flow both surfaces run; it counts `secondsLeft` rather than
    formatting a clock. `useCurrentPairing`, `usePairingTokens` and `useHosts`'s
    poll are its internals and leave the barrel; the unused `usePairHost` is gone.
  - `@oppenheimer/translations`: new `hosts` namespace for the pairing copy both
    surfaces read, `sessions.new.addHost.*` for the dialog's own words, and
    `common.close`.

- f099524: Ship the PostHog web analytics adapter, driven by `VITE_POSTHOG_KEY`.
- 1ad71b4: Split `DataTable` so the search field, the selection and the rows stop sharing a clock: a keystroke now re-renders zero rows. `useTableQuery` keeps one `search` — the settled value — and no longer debounces its URL write.
- f099524: Ship `useZodResolver`, which wires `createZodErrorMap` into React Hook Form.
- 8fab63d: Add server-evaluated feature flags, wired into the API and the console.

  Flags are declared in code, targeted in the database, evaluated on the server
  and read on every client from one endpoint — the shape Stripe and Revolut
  describe for their own. Ported from the Flama starter.

  - **`@oppenheimer/shared`** gains `feature-flags/`: the `FEATURE_FLAGS` catalog
    (every flag the code may read, with its kind, owner, safe default and — for
    temporary flags — expiry), the pure evaluator (ordered rules, segments,
    semver targeting on the app build, deterministic MurmurHash3 percentage
    splits bucketed by organization), and the Zod schemas for targeting writes.
    Like `agents` and `protocol` it is reached through its own subpaths, not the
    root barrel: `@oppenheimer/shared/feature-flags`, and the Zod-free
    `@oppenheimer/shared/feature-flags/catalog` for the web bundle. A `flags`
    scope group, a `FeatureFlag` subject and a `GET /feature-flags/admin`
    endpoint policy join the catalogs.
  - **`@oppenheimer/api`** gains a `feature-flags` module. Every replica holds
    all targeting in memory and evaluates without I/O, polling a cheap
    fingerprint to stay in sync and keeping its last good snapshot through a
    database blip. `GET /v1/feature-flags` serves the caller's evaluated client
    flags (signed out too); the endpoints under `/v1/feature-flags/admin`,
    `/segments` and `/changes` edit targeting, pull kill switches, manage
    segments, explain an evaluation and read the audit trail, which every change
    lands on through the outbox. `@RequireFlag('key')` gates a route on a flag,
    and token creation is now behind the `api_token_creation` kill switch. New
    error codes `FLAG_001`–`FLAG_007`. Migration `AddFeatureFlags`, every point
    in time `timestamptz`.
  - **`@oppenheimer/api-client`**: the regenerated client carries the feature
    flag operations and DTOs.
  - **`@oppenheimer/frontend-core`**: a `feature-flags` kernel module and
    `useFeatureFlag` / `useFeatureFlagValue` / `useFeatureFlags`, typed by the
    catalog, reading the API rather than PostHog. Flags are prefetched as soon as
    the session is known, persisted with the query cache, and an `experiment`
    flag records a `feature_flag_exposed` event. `OppenheimerApp.create` takes
    `featureFlags: { platform, appVersion }`.

    **Breaking:** feature flags leave the analytics port. `IAnalyticsClient` no
    longer has `getFeatureFlags` / `onFeatureFlags`, `AnalyticsService` no longer
    serves flags, `analyticsKeys.flags` is gone, and `isFlagEnabled` moved to the
    `feature-flags` module. `useFeatureFlag(key)` keeps its name but now takes a
    catalog key and reads the server's answer.

  - **`@oppenheimer/frontend-web`**: the PostHog adapter drops its flag methods
    and switches PostHog's own flag loading off.
  - **`@oppenheimer/translations`**: messages for `FLAG_001`–`FLAG_007`, and the
    control-plane copy for a flags screen (`control.flags`, `nav.featureFlags`).
  - **`@oppenheimer/web`** reports its platform and build when it asks for its
    flags.

  `pnpm check:flags` (in CI) fails on a temporary flag past its expiry date and
  on a flag the catalog declares but no code reads.

- b9fb2ce: `AuthLayout` drops its `legal` prop. How a page is framed is now route
  `staticData` the layout reads off the innermost match: `authWidth` for the
  column, and `legalNoteKey` for the line under it — absent for the default
  terms-and-privacy line, a key for a page's own, `null` for none. The
  `declare module` block that types them moves into the component, so there is
  no side-effect import to remember.
