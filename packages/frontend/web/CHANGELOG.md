# @oppenheimer/frontend-web

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- e711f5c: Add a host leads with the agent prompt, in onboarding and in the console's
  dialog, as the 2026-10-13 design export draws it.

  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-web`: `PairingChrome` is agent first: the agent
    prompt in a card with Copy prompt (its text behind a fold), the token line
    with "Install manually instead" across from it (the install command on
    one line with its Copy, and the installer's digest), and a Connection
    list — Runner installed with its version, then Host connected with the
    machine's name and OS. The two folds are `Disclosure`s; the chrome's
    root carries `data-layout`, and each part sizes itself from it, so
    `PairingToken`, `PairingInstruction` and `PairingStatus` lose their
    `layout` prop. `PairedMachine` gains `runnerVersion`.
  - `@oppenheimer/web`: the onboarding step puts Continue, Skip for now and
    its note on one row; the dialog's copy follows the export.
  - `@oppenheimer/design-system-web`: `Disclosure`'s doc no longer names Add
    a host.
  - `@oppenheimer/web-showcase`: the Add a host demo draws the same column.
  - `@oppenheimer/translations`: `hosts.pairing` gains `manual`,
    `manualLead`, `connection`, `installWaiting`,
    `installed` and `connected`; `copyPrompt` reads "Copy prompt";
    `copyCommand` and `inspect` are removed. `hosts.add.description`,
    `onboarding.flow.host.description` and `skipNote` follow the export.

- 581c202: Bot settings polish (`product/versions/mvp/25-bots.md`, 2026-10-16).

  - `@oppenheimer/api`: `GET /bots/:id/conversation/export` streams the whole
    chat as NDJSON, one message per line, a page at a time; `DELETE /bots/:id/conversation` clears it (turns,
    messages, cards, summary, sidebar line) in one transaction, refused with
    `BOTS_022` while a turn is queued or running; the conversation read
    carries `messageCount`.
  - `@oppenheimer/api-client`: `exportBotConversation`, `clearBotConversation`,
    `messageCount`.
  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-consumer`: `useSuspenseBotHistory`,
    `useExportBotConversation` (reads the NDJSON stream a line at a time),
    `useClearBotConversation`.
  - `@oppenheimer/backend-core`: `ndjsonLines` and `NDJSON_CONTENT_TYPE`.
  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-web`: `SettingsFormSaveRow`, the dirty / pending /
    saved foot of a settings form.
  - `@oppenheimer/design-system-web`: `SettingsListRow`'s `kind` tag never wraps;
    the meta beside it does.
  - `@oppenheimer/translations`: Home host, chat history, `BOTS_022`, and the
    shorter ChatGPT sign-in chip.

- 27f034a: The wordmark stands alone: the console's brand row and the auth and public
  pages show "Oppenheimer" without the "Console" suffix. `Wordmark` loses its
  `product` prop, `BrandLogo` is gone (the auth and public chrome draw
  `Wordmark` directly), `AuthLayout` loses its `product` prop, and the
  `common.product` key is gone from the catalogs.

### Patch Changes

- 231fb59: A form's fields stand at one height. `DatePicker` (28px, though its notes
  said 34px) and `FieldSelect`'s field look (42px) take a `size` on the control
  ramp and default to `md`, 34px, the same rung as `Input`, on the same field
  border and fill. `Chip` takes `size="md"` for a chip that is a form's field,
  and `TimeField`'s trigger moves to `md` beside the `DatePicker`.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 24d217d: Add host is a dialog in the console.

  - `@oppenheimer/web`: New session's host chip opens the Add host dialog instead
    of navigating to `/onboarding/host`; the dialog owns the Command / Agent
    prompt switch, the panel and a footer that arms on a registered host.
  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-web`: new `hosts` concern with `HostPairingChrome` —
    the token line and the status row the onboarding step and the dialog both
    draw.
  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-consumer`: `useHostPairing` (in `react/hosts.pairing.ts`)
    is the pairing flow both surfaces run; it counts `secondsLeft` rather than
    formatting a clock. `useCurrentPairing`, `usePairingTokens` and `useHosts`'s
    poll are its internals and leave the barrel; the unused `usePairHost` is gone.
  - `@oppenheimer/translations`: new `hosts` namespace for the pairing copy both
    surfaces read, `sessions.new.addHost.*` for the dialog's own words, and
    `common.close`.

- f099524: Ship the PostHog web analytics adapter, driven by `VITE_POSTHOG_KEY`.
- ab97201: Unused code is removed, and each barrel exports only what the console imports; `pnpm check:unused` holds it there.
- c05c4ff: - The shell frames a page at the route's measure: `staticData.pane` is a size
  of `EditorPageBody`, or `full`. `measure` is gone.
  - `EditorPageBody` takes `size` instead of `wide`; `TaskBoard`'s `gutter` prop
    is gone.
- d5d310c: An organization's repositories can be reached from the project dialog, and a requested organization install is said rather than dropped.
- 473557a: - `EditorPageBody`'s `size` is a measure the export repeats: `status`,
  `composer`, `narrow`, `wide`, `board`, `fluid`. A child opts in to the
  frame's edge with `data-bleed`.
  - The shell frames the page; `EditorPage` paints no ground.
  - `staticData.pane` may be a function of the route's search.
  - The kit adds `PaneBar` and `usePaneDrop`; the design system exports
    `DropOutline`.
- a66c1fe: - `@oppenheimer/frontend-web`: the `hosts` concern is `pairing`, and its components are `PairingChrome`, `PairingToken`, `PairingStatus`, `PairingCopyButtons` and `PairingInstruction`; `AppPending` and `SessionRestoreError` are added.
  - `@oppenheimer/tsconfig`: the app dependency-cruiser rules add `providers-mount-dialogs` and `features-query-through-the-product`.
  - `@oppenheimer/web`: `features/installations/`.
- 2dc27d2: Plan: a task board, goals and a calendar, the console rail's third item
  (`product/versions/mvp/17-plan.md`).

  - `@oppenheimer/api`: the `tasks` module (tasks, goals, the board's order,
    starting or linking a session, the attach rule) and the `calendar` module
    (personal events, read-only Google Calendar through a port, the sealed
    refresh token under `CALENDAR_TOKEN_KEY`), with the `google_calendar`
    capability, two migrations and the `Task` and `Calendar` rules on `owner`.
  - `@oppenheimer/web`: `/plan` (the board and its dialogs), `/plan/calendar`
    (the month and its layers) and `/plan/calendar/google` (Google's return),
    the Plan rail item, and "Back to task" in a session's status bar.
  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-consumer`: the `tasks` and `calendar` modules and
    their query hooks; `toCreateSessionRequest` is shared by both start paths.
  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-web`: `DateField`, `TimeField` and calendar-day
    helpers in the `i18n` concern.
  - `@oppenheimer/api-client`: regenerated for the new routes.
  - `@oppenheimer/shared`: the task, goal and calendar schemas, the `tasks` and
    `calendar` scopes and the `Task` and `Calendar` subjects.
  - `@oppenheimer/translations`: the `tasks` and `calendar` namespaces,
    `nav.plan`, the date and time field copy and the new toasts.

- b32d3b8: - `@oppenheimer/frontend-core`: `useQuery` and `useQueries` that share entities across refetches.
  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-consumer`: every query hook goes through them.
  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-web`: `createDialogSlot` replaces `ConsoleDialogProvider`, `useConsoleDialog` and `useConsoleList`; `SidebarSearchField` is added.
  - `@oppenheimer/design-system-web`: `useNow` shares one timer per interval; `FieldSelect` no longer reads a ref in render.
  - `@oppenheimer/web`: fewer re-renders in the sidebars and the project dialog.
- 1ad71b4: Split `DataTable` so the search field, the selection and the rows stop sharing a clock: a keystroke now re-renders zero rows. `useTableQuery` keeps one `search` — the settled value — and no longer debounces its URL write.
- f099524: Ship `useZodResolver`, which wires `createZodErrorMap` into React Hook Form.
- 8fab63d: Add server-evaluated feature flags, wired into the API and the console.

  Flags are declared in code, targeted in the database, evaluated on the server
  and read on every client from one endpoint — the shape Stripe and Revolut
  describe for their own. Ported from the Flama starter.

  - **`@oppenheimer/shared`** gains `feature-flags/`: the `FEATURE_FLAGS` catalog
    (every flag the code may read, with its kind, owner, safe default and — for
    temporary flags — expiry), the pure evaluator (ordered rules, segments,
    semver targeting on the app build, deterministic MurmurHash3 percentage
    splits bucketed by organization), and the Zod schemas for targeting writes.
    Like `agents` and `protocol` it is reached through its own subpaths, not the
    root barrel: `@oppenheimer/shared/feature-flags`, and the Zod-free
    `@oppenheimer/shared/feature-flags/catalog` for the web bundle. A `flags`
    scope group, a `FeatureFlag` subject and a `GET /feature-flags/admin`
    endpoint policy join the catalogs.
  - **`@oppenheimer/api`** gains a `feature-flags` module. Every replica holds
    all targeting in memory and evaluates without I/O, polling a cheap
    fingerprint to stay in sync and keeping its last good snapshot through a
    database blip. `GET /v1/feature-flags` serves the caller's evaluated client
    flags (signed out too); the endpoints under `/v1/feature-flags/admin`,
    `/segments` and `/changes` edit targeting, pull kill switches, manage
    segments, explain an evaluation and read the audit trail, which every change
    lands on through the outbox. `@RequireFlag('key')` gates a route on a flag,
    and token creation is now behind the `api_token_creation` kill switch. New
    error codes `FLAG_001`–`FLAG_007`. Migration `AddFeatureFlags`, every point
    in time `timestamptz`.
  - **`@oppenheimer/api-client`**: the regenerated client carries the feature
    flag operations and DTOs.
  - **`@oppenheimer/frontend-core`**: a `feature-flags` kernel module and
    `useFeatureFlag` / `useFeatureFlagValue` / `useFeatureFlags`, typed by the
    catalog, reading the API rather than PostHog. Flags are prefetched as soon as
    the session is known, persisted with the query cache, and an `experiment`
    flag records a `feature_flag_exposed` event. `OppenheimerApp.create` takes
    `featureFlags: { platform, appVersion }`.

    **Breaking:** feature flags leave the analytics port. `IAnalyticsClient` no
    longer has `getFeatureFlags` / `onFeatureFlags`, `AnalyticsService` no longer
    serves flags, `analyticsKeys.flags` is gone, and `isFlagEnabled` moved to the
    `feature-flags` module. `useFeatureFlag(key)` keeps its name but now takes a
    catalog key and reads the server's answer.

  - **`@oppenheimer/frontend-web`**: the PostHog adapter drops its flag methods
    and switches PostHog's own flag loading off.
  - **`@oppenheimer/translations`**: messages for `FLAG_001`–`FLAG_007`, and the
    control-plane copy for a flags screen (`control.flags`, `nav.featureFlags`).
  - **`@oppenheimer/web`** reports its platform and build when it asks for its
    flags.

  `pnpm check:flags` (in CI) fails on a temporary flag past its expiry date and
  on a flag the catalog declares but no code reads.

- 3e6e3dc: Settings → Hosts, as `design/version1/Settings.dc.html` draws it: a page in its own frame, reached from the account menu, listing the workspace's hosts as cards (status, running sessions, OS · vCPU · runner version, connected or last seen) with inline rename, copy ID and remove, and Add a host opening inside the same frame. `HostCard`, `SettingsNav`, `PageHeader`, `RoutineSteps` and the tabbed `CodeBlock` panel now measure as the version-1 export does.
- 43a17c1: - **frontend-web**: `notifySuccess`, the success toast, which takes a `toasts.*` key.
  - **web**: toasts the writes whose result is easy to miss, and deleting an automation asks through one confirm dialog on the table and on its page.
  - **translations**: success copy under `toasts.*`.
- b9fb2ce: `AuthLayout` drops its `legal` prop. How a page is framed is now route
  `staticData` the layout reads off the innermost match: `authWidth` for the
  column, and `legalNoteKey` for the line under it — absent for the default
  terms-and-privacy line, a key for a page's own, `null` for none. The
  `declare module` block that types them moves into the component, so there is
  no side-effect import to remember.
- a0e23bd: Search params are Zod schemas (`searchText`, `searchFlag`, `searchPage`) and nuqs is removed; the `one-api-client` rule and the removed `sessions.agents` keys ride along.

### Patch Changes

- 99219f9: The console mounts the automations overview, runs, run view, editor and sidebar against the consumer's `automations` module.
- ba9abd0: Timing and retry decisions move to `CORE_CONFIG`
  (`@oppenheimer/frontend-core/config`) and `CONSUMER_CONFIG`
  (`@oppenheimer/frontend-consumer/config`); `createQueryClient`'s `staleTime`
  now defaults to the kernel's. Values are unchanged.
- c412130: The Pull requests area reads the repositories you watch, and nothing until you
  watch one. The queue answers with the rows it could fill and fills more over
  the reads that follow, rather than making you wait for every part of every row;
  a pull request it has not read yet is left out instead of shown with a lane and
  a checks state nobody read. Your own pull requests are recognised from a
  personal installation when you have no stored GitHub grant. The review
  period's numbers are kept in the browser's cache, so Analytics draws them at
  once instead of a skeleton, and a quarter's chart is drawn by the week, as the
  artboard draws it. What a read could not show is one notice rather than a
  callout per repository, part and refusal.
- f099524: Follow the `@oppenheimer/config` → `@oppenheimer/tsconfig` rename.
- be76e39: The PostHog adapter drops its queued events, and every call after it, once the
  SDK fails to load, instead of holding them in a long-lived tab for a client
  that never arrives.
