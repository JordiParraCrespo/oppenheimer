# @oppenheimer/design-system-web

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 50429c4: A bot's effort saves once per adjustment, when its picker closes, instead of once per stop the knob crosses, which a drag across the track turned into a burst of updates the API refused as too many requests. `EffortPicker` takes an optional `onOpenChange` so the caller can tell when it closes.
- 73ce336: Port the 2026-10-13 evening export: `BotExchange` and `ProposedFile` in the chat's cards, `ComposerApproval` fused onto the composer through its new `above` slot, `BotItem`'s `needsInput`, `SidebarProjectHeader`'s eyebrow tone and `marker`, `SidebarEmptyCard`, `TemplateTiles` and a centred `ChatEmptyState`.
- 663e8ed: The 2026-10-13 export's new components. Settings controls: `Switch`,
  `PillGroup` (one value or a set) and `NumberStepper`. Share: `PeoplePicker`
  with `PersonChip`, and `AccessList`. Plan: `MilestoneTimeline` and
  `MilestoneGlyph`, `FacetSelect`, `DateRangePicker`, `AreaChart` and
  `CalendarAccountList`. Employees: `BotItem` (and `SortableBotItem`),
  `AvatarPicker`, `RoutineCard`, `SettingsListRow`, `SettingsAddRow` and
  `SettingsTopBar`. The agent chat, one file per family of the Chat Components
  inventory: transcript, work and tools, cards, dividers and status, the
  composer stack, decisions, composer extras and the header. Adds the
  `--selected-fg` token and the `shimmer` and `caret` animations.
- 231fb59: A form's fields stand at one height. `DatePicker` (28px, though its notes
  said 34px) and `FieldSelect`'s field look (42px) take a `size` on the control
  ramp and default to `md`, 34px, the same rung as `Input`, on the same field
  border and fill. `Chip` takes `size="md"` for a chip that is a form's field,
  and `TimeField`'s trigger moves to `md` beside the `DatePicker`.
- d4606c6: Pull requests on the 2026-10-13 screens, without the chat and the review
  agent.

  - `@oppenheimer/shared`, `@oppenheimer/api`, `@oppenheimer/api-client`: a
    review's verdict is `comment`, `approve`, `approve_and_merge` or
    `request_changes`. `approve` only approves now; `approve_and_merge`
    merges at once when GitHub allows it and otherwise turns on GitHub's
    auto-merge, answering `{ merged, autoMerge }`. The queue is ordered by
    lane (Deep first) and then the longest wait, and the path to merge is
    three gates (checks, conflicts, merge).
  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-consumer`: `ReviewOutcome`; the activity read
    (`usePullRequestActivity`) is removed.
  - `@oppenheimer/web`: a pull request is Description and Changes (a link to
    `?view=briefing` opens the description); the queue filters by repository,
    Difficulty, Checks and Waiting, with `j`/`k`, Enter and `/`; Review opens
    the changes; Settings → Watched repositories is where watching is set.
  - `@oppenheimer/design-system-web`: `MergePath` is the one-row status strip;
    `PullRequestTable` folds in three widths (1080px, 720px); `ChipSelect`
    options take a `count`. `FactTile`, `FactGrid`, `DiffCommentLink` and the
    Stepper's horizontal orientation are removed.
  - `@oppenheimer/translations`: the new queue, review, Settings and toast
    copy; the briefing, rail, activity and lane-reason keys are removed.

- 45d642b: A session runs in a new worktree or in a folder already on the host
  (`product/versions/mvp/24-session-places.md`).

  - `@oppenheimer/runner`: the work folder is `~/oppenheimer/<account>/<workspace>/{repos,
agents, sessions}`, with bare stores and a `.oppenheimer/` marker in every
    folder the runner makes; a folder session runs in the person's folder and
    writes nothing there; `fs.list` lists a host's directories. The old
    `~/oppenheimer-ai/workspaces` layout is not migrated.
  - `@oppenheimer/shared`: `session.create` carries the account and workspace
    ids and either checkouts or a `folder`; `fs.list` / `fs.listing`; the
    `session.folder` and `fs.list` capabilities; `createSessionSchema` takes a
    `folder` instead of checkouts.
  - `@oppenheimer/api`: `work_session` records the place and the folder;
    `GET /v1/hosts/{id}/folders` lists a folder through the runner with the
    caller's recent folders; `SESSIONS_025`–`031`.
  - `@oppenheimer/web`: New session's Where chip (New worktree, Folder on
    host), the folder picker, Open terminal on a host in Settings, folder and
    terminal icons in the sidebar. The permission level opens on `auto` and is
    remembered.
  - `@oppenheimer/design-system-web`: `Composer` takes `allowEmpty`, so a
    blank terminal can start with no first task.

- fe61b51: Sharing a session follows the `ShareSession` design
  (`product/versions/mvp/21-session-share-links.md`): one share per session
  at one address, `/s/<slug>`, for named people or anyone signed in; view, or
  write for named people for 24 hours at most. The Share dialog opens from a
  row's menu and the terminal's status line, and the guest page is one bar
  and the terminal. The share-link routes are replaced by
  `GET`/`PUT`/`DELETE /v1/sessions/{id}/share` and
  `PATCH /v1/sessions/{id}/share/people`; existing links are dropped. The
  design system gains `RadioGroupCard` (with `columns` on `RadioGroup`) and an
  `actions` slot on `SessionPaneHeader`.
- 27f034a: The wordmark stands alone: the console's brand row and the auth and public
  pages show "Oppenheimer" without the "Console" suffix. `Wordmark` loses its
  `product` prop, `BrandLogo` is gone (the auth and public chrome draw
  `Wordmark` directly), `AuthLayout` loses its `product` prop, and the
  `common.product` key is gone from the catalogs.

### Patch Changes

- e711f5c: Add a host leads with the agent prompt, in onboarding and in the console's
  dialog, as the 2026-10-13 design export draws it.

  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-web`: `PairingChrome` is agent first: the agent
    prompt in a card with Copy prompt (its text behind a fold), the token line
    with "Install manually instead" across from it (the install command on
    one line with its Copy, and the installer's digest), and a Connection
    list — Runner installed with its version, then Host connected with the
    machine's name and OS. The two folds are `Disclosure`s; the chrome's
    root carries `data-layout`, and each part sizes itself from it, so
    `PairingToken`, `PairingInstruction` and `PairingStatus` lose their
    `layout` prop. `PairedMachine` gains `runnerVersion`.
  - `@oppenheimer/web`: the onboarding step puts Continue, Skip for now and
    its note on one row; the dialog's copy follows the export.
  - `@oppenheimer/design-system-web`: `Disclosure`'s doc no longer names Add
    a host.
  - `@oppenheimer/web-showcase`: the Add a host demo draws the same column.
  - `@oppenheimer/translations`: `hosts.pairing` gains `manual`,
    `manualLead`, `connection`, `installWaiting`,
    `installed` and `connected`; `copyPrompt` reads "Copy prompt";
    `copyCommand` and `inspect` are removed. `hosts.add.description`,
    `onboarding.flow.host.description` and `skipNote` follow the export.

- 581c202: Bot settings polish (`product/versions/mvp/25-bots.md`, 2026-10-16).

  - `@oppenheimer/api`: `GET /bots/:id/conversation/export` streams the whole
    chat as NDJSON, one message per line, a page at a time; `DELETE /bots/:id/conversation` clears it (turns,
    messages, cards, summary, sidebar line) in one transaction, refused with
    `BOTS_022` while a turn is queued or running; the conversation read
    carries `messageCount`.
  - `@oppenheimer/api-client`: `exportBotConversation`, `clearBotConversation`,
    `messageCount`.
  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-consumer`: `useSuspenseBotHistory`,
    `useExportBotConversation` (reads the NDJSON stream a line at a time),
    `useClearBotConversation`.
  - `@oppenheimer/backend-core`: `ndjsonLines` and `NDJSON_CONTENT_TYPE`.
  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-web`: `SettingsFormSaveRow`, the dirty / pending /
    saved foot of a settings form.
  - `@oppenheimer/design-system-web`: `SettingsListRow`'s `kind` tag never wraps;
    the meta beside it does.
  - `@oppenheimer/translations`: Home host, chat history, `BOTS_022`, and the
    shorter ChatGPT sign-in chip.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 1a51afc: Rebrand onto the Alpaca Labs visual language: monochrome-first, flat tokens with `globals.css` as the single source of truth, sixteen new components, five chat primitives, and every overlay brought onto the brand's metrics.
- 1ed003e: The automations pages, the editor, the sidebars and Settings match the
  2026-09-27 frames.

  - `@oppenheimer/design-system-web`: `EditorPage` sits on the recessed canvas;
    `FieldSelect` gains a quiet variant with `FieldSelectGroup` / `FieldSelectRow`;
    `StatusDot` gains a compact density; `SidebarListHead` and
    `SidebarProjectGroup` join the sidebar; `BrandGlyph` takes the theme's ink by
    default.
  - `@oppenheimer/web`: an automation opens on Back and the ordinary page header,
    run history is drawn before the first run, and New session sits on the grey
    canvas with a line saying what sending will do.
  - `@oppenheimer/translations`: copy for the repository count and New session's
    line.

- cb56034: Give `ChipSelect`'s parts and `DropdownMenuRadioItem` a density, so the
  composer's two menus are a shape the components own rather than measurements
  restated at each call site: `ChipSelectPopup`, `ChipSelectItem`,
  `ChipSelectSearch` and `ChipSelectBack` take `density="menu"` for the engine
  pane, and `DropdownMenuRadioItem` takes `density="compact"` for the permission
  menu. New `ChipSelectList` is one pane body — rows, the loading line, or the
  empty one — and caps itself in rows of its density; `ChipSelectEmpty` takes
  `live` for a list still being read, and `ChipSelectItem` takes `trailing` for a
  row that ends in something other than a check. `ChipSelect` and
  `RepositorySelect` take `loading`, and `RepositorySelect` a separate
  `branchesLoading` for its branch pane.
- 9431938: The design system draws a session's host going offline and coming back
  (a banner in the status bar's place by default, a card over the scrollback
  as the other form), the command to copy that brings it back, an offline
  host's detail on Settings, and a pane that takes dropped files.
- 08d42f1: A generic drag layer, and Plan in the design system: the task board and
  goals, the month calendar, the date picker and the session pane's header.
  `PageHeaderRow` takes a `display` size.
- 121d28a: Pull requests in the design system: the queue, a pull request's briefing
  and review decision, the diff with its comments and file tree (on
  @pierre/diffs and @pierre/trees), file-type marks, the review analytics'
  charts, and a rail the reader can reorder. `SegmentedControl` takes `md`
  and `lg` sizes and item counts; `StatusDot` gains the gate states
  `passing`, `blocked` and `waiting`; `Badge` gains `strong` and `soft`;
  `Stepper` lays out horizontally; `RadioGroup` is new; the dark chart teal and violet moved to
  pass colour-blind separation.
- c983201: The sidebar's sessions reorder by dragging, inside a project or into another
  one (`SortableSessionItem`). A sortable row that is also a link picks up on
  Space so Enter still opens it, and the screen reader is told so
  (`useSortableControl`).
- 09cea4c: Effort is each CLI's own levels, per model, instead of five product stops.

  - `@oppenheimer/shared`: each model lists its effort levels and default, each agent spells a level once, and `effortLevelFor` decides what may be recorded.
  - `@oppenheimer/runner`: launch effort is keyed by model and dropped when the model lacks it or the saved launch predates levels.
  - `@oppenheimer/api` / `@oppenheimer/api-client`: sessions, their log and automation revisions record only a level their model offers.
  - `@oppenheimer/web` / `@oppenheimer/translations`: the slider draws the model's levels and sends nothing until moved.
  - `@oppenheimer/design-system-web`: `EffortSlider` and `EffortPicker` take their stops from the caller; `EFFORT_STOPS` is gone.

- c05c4ff: - The shell frames a page at the route's measure: `staticData.pane` is a size
  of `EditorPageBody`, or `full`. `measure` is gone.
  - `EditorPageBody` takes `size` instead of `wide`; `TaskBoard`'s `gutter` prop
    is gone.
- d5d310c: An organization's repositories can be reached from the project dialog, and a requested organization install is said rather than dropped.
- 473557a: - `EditorPageBody`'s `size` is a measure the export repeats: `status`,
  `composer`, `narrow`, `wide`, `board`, `fluid`. A child opts in to the
  frame's edge with `data-bleed`.
  - The shell frames the page; `EditorPage` paints no ground.
  - `staticData.pane` may be a function of the route's search.
  - The kit adds `PaneBar` and `usePaneDrop`; the design system exports
    `DropOutline`.
- 0918701: `SettingsForm`, and `SettingsRow`'s `control="field"` width.
- c237a5f: The console's sidebar reorders by dragging: a project by its header among
  the others (`SortableSidebarProjectGroup`), and a session within its project
  or into another one, which moves it there. The order is kept on the device,
  and the sort menu gains Custom order, its new default.
  `useSortableGroups` tells `onChange` when a drag settles and hands `onMove`
  the value it settled on; a session write stays pending until the session
  lists have refetched.

### Patch Changes

- eff0947: A bar chart's x axis draws at most sixteen labels, evenly spaced, always
  including the first bar of each month. Ninety bars of eight pixels each drew
  ninety labels into a single grey smear.
- 080641e: `BarChart`'s bars are pills, round at both ends, as the export draws them
  (`border-radius: 980px`), instead of a 4px rounding on top only.
- 287d688: Composer: give the prompt box back the height the design gives it.

  `field-sizing-content` sizes a textarea to its content and overrides the `rows`
  attribute outright, so the empty composer collapsed to a single line while every
  class still looked correct. The export's floor is 112px, which is the prompt box
  having presence before anyone has typed into it — the whole point of the
  control. It is a `min-h` now, with `rows` kept as the no-`field-sizing`
  fallback.

  Measured against `.op-composer__input` in the same pass: the textarea's vertical
  padding is 16px both sides rather than 16/8, the attach and mic buttons are the
  export's 30px tool rather than the 28px `sm` control, and their glyphs and the
  send arrow are 15px at stroke 2.2.

  The type is a new `text-compose` step (16px/1.5). The export declares 16px
  nowhere but this one rule — it sits between body (15px) and body-lg (17px) —
  which is the same case `text-operate` already documents, so it is a named token
  with a comment rather than an arbitrary value or a rounding to the nearest step.

- c5437b1: The console's rail can be put in the reader's own order by dragging.

  - `@oppenheimer/web`: the rail's items are sortable; a press still opens the
    list, a drag past 5px or Space picks one up, and the order is kept on this
    device. The items are one table, `RAIL` in `features/sessions/lib/rail-order.ts`.
  - `@oppenheimer/design-system-web`: `RailItem` joins a caller's
    `aria-describedby` with its count's, so a `SortableRailItem`'s count is
    still read out beside the drag instructions; a lifted rail item is a
    round pill on the card surface, not the card-shaped box.

- 94a700e: - `@oppenheimer/web`: the console's Settings and project glyphs follow the spec in 05.
  - `@oppenheimer/design-system-web`: a `ChipSelect` action takes a `trailing` mark, and `EffortPicker`'s hint describes its slider.
- 5bd4a8b: New session sets how a session is launched, and `POST /sessions` takes it.

  The route grows a `launch` object — model, permission level, effort — and the
  `prompt` typed into the composer. The launch is folded onto `work_session` so a
  restart can relaunch a session the way it was launched without walking its log.
  The prompt is a log entry and rides `session.create` to the host, where it
  becomes the agent's trailing argument rather than something typed at a running
  terminal — so nothing about the composer waits on the relay, and exactly one of
  the two ends ever writes `prompt.first`. It also names the session, through a
  new `openai-compatible` namer provider that covers Groq, Together, vLLM and a
  local Ollama.

  The agent catalog in `@oppenheimer/shared` grows each agent's models and the
  argv its permission levels, effort stops and first task map to, read off
  claude 2.1.278's and codex-cli 0.155.1's own `--help`.

  **Breaking, `@oppenheimer/frontend-consumer`:** `SessionEntity` was modelling one
  repository, one branch and a `running | idle | stopped` state the control plane
  had stopped sending. It carries `checkouts`, the derived `state` group and the
  stored `lifecycle` now, and `create` takes an idempotency key from its caller.

- 6b943c3: Removing a host stops its sessions on the machine, as the remove dialog says.
- b32d3b8: - `@oppenheimer/frontend-core`: `useQuery` and `useQueries` that share entities across refetches.
  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-consumer`: every query hook goes through them.
  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-web`: `createDialogSlot` replaces `ConsoleDialogProvider`, `useConsoleDialog` and `useConsoleList`; `SidebarSearchField` is added.
  - `@oppenheimer/design-system-web`: `useNow` shares one timer per interval; `FieldSelect` no longer reads a ref in render.
  - `@oppenheimer/web`: fewer re-renders in the sidebars and the project dialog.
- 3e6e3dc: Settings → Hosts, as `design/version1/Settings.dc.html` draws it: a page in its own frame, reached from the account menu, listing the workspace's hosts as cards (status, running sessions, OS · vCPU · runner version, connected or last seen) with inline rename, copy ID and remove, and Add a host opening inside the same frame. `HostCard`, `SettingsNav`, `PageHeader`, `RoutineSteps` and the tabbed `CodeBlock` panel now measure as the version-1 export does.
- 4ffcdd6: Plan's columns line up with the header and the goals above them. The board's
  scroller reaches into the page's gutter on its own (`TaskBoard`'s `gutter`),
  the way the artboard draws it, instead of the whole board hanging 32px to the
  left of the page.
- 1a51afc: Declare `sideEffects` (CSS excepted).
