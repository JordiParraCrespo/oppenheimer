# @oppenheimer/backend-email

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- fc0e75d: The hosts backend for the Settings page (`product/versions/mvp/14-hosts-settings.md`).

  - `@oppenheimer/api`: a host read carries a derived `status` (`running`, `idle`,
    `offline`, `unpaired`) and `runningSessionCount`, counted by `sessions/`
    through `HostsModule.contributeUsage`. `GET /v1/hosts` leaves unpaired hosts
    out unless `include=unpaired`. Removing a host, from either end, stops the
    sessions running on it. New `GET /v1/hosts/pairing/{id}` returns the token and
    the host it paired, for Add host's "Listening for this host…".
  - `@oppenheimer/shared`: `HOST_STATUSES`, `listHostsQuerySchema`, and an
    optional `cpus` on the host facts, on both Zod entry points.
  - `@oppenheimer/api-client`: regenerated; `getPairingToken`,
    `PairingTokenStatusResponseDto`, `HostStatus`.
  - `@oppenheimer/runner`: the facts report the logical CPU count as `cpus`.
  - `@oppenheimer/api`: host metadata tables (`host_inventory`, `host_presence`,
    `host_network`, `host_event`), backfilled from `host`; the old columns stay
    until the code switches over (`product/versions/mvp/15-host-metadata.md`).
  - `@oppenheimer/api`: heartbeats write `host_presence` and, only when the
    machine changed, `host_inventory`, with the change on the host's timeline;
    host responses carry `machine`, `vitals` and `network`;
    `GET /v1/hosts/{id}/timeline`. The network a runner connects from is
    recorded and placed with DB-IP Lite (`HOSTS_GEOIP_CITY_DB`,
    `HOSTS_GEOIP_ASN_DB`, the `ip_geolocation` capability); a move to another
    country or network operator emails the owner. A daily job purges networks
    unseen for 90 days and timeline entries past 180.
  - `@oppenheimer/runner`: reports OS name, kernel, CPU model, memory, disk
    total, virtualization, cloud, time zone, boot time and service manager,
    and available memory on the heartbeat.
  - `@oppenheimer/backend-email`: `sendHostNetworkChanged` and its template.
  - `@oppenheimer/translations`: `emails.hostNetworkChanged`.

- 2f7fdce: `LlmError` gains the `rate_limited` code and `resetAt`; `@oppenheimer/backend-email` gains `EmailRateLimitedError`. The email worker holds its queue until a provider's reset.

### Patch Changes

- be76e39: The SMTP driver speaks implicit TLS on port 465 (other ports keep upgrading
  with STARTTLS) and sends `auth` only when both `SMTP_USER` and `SMTP_PASS` are
  set, so a relay configured with a host alone is no longer asked to log in with
  blank credentials.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 4943eff: Add Better Auth admin (super-admin) and organization (with workspaces) plugins.

  Authentication already ran on Better Auth; this enables its official `admin` and
  `organization` plugins and wires them into the app, plus organization-scoped
  CASL authorization.

  - **`@oppenheimer/api`**: enable the `admin` plugin (super-admin: list/ban/impersonate
    users, set roles, revoke sessions — gated by the new `superadmin`/`admin`
    roles and `BETTER_AUTH_ADMIN_USER_IDS`) and the `organization` plugin
    (organizations, members, invitations, and **workspaces** via teams). New users
    get a personal organization + default workspace on sign-up; sessions carry
    `activeOrganizationId` / `activeTeamId`. Adds ORM entities + a migration for
    `organization`/`member`/`invitation`/`team`/`teamMember`, the admin columns
    (`user.banned`/`banReason`/`banExpires`, `session.impersonatedBy`), and a
    seeded `superadmin` system role. `PoliciesGuard`/`AbilityFactory` now thread
    `session.activeOrganizationId` into CASL so permissions can be org-scoped with
    `${activeOrganizationId}` conditions. System roles that grant `manage all` are
    protected from being stripped of it (admin-lockout guard).

  - **`@oppenheimer/shared`**: new `superadmin` system role and `ORGANIZATION_ROLES`;
    new Zod schemas/types for organization, member, invitation, workspace, and
    admin operations; `activeOrganizationId` / `activeTeamId` added to the CASL
    ability context; new `Organization`/`Workspace`/`Member`/`Invitation`/
    `AuditLog` known subjects. Removes the vestigial `JwtPayload`, `TokenPair`,
    `AuthProvider` types and the unused `AUTH` token-expiry constants.

  - **`@oppenheimer/backend-email`**: new `EmailService.sendInvitation` + invitation
    React Email template, sent asynchronously through the email queue.

  After deploying, run the migration (`pnpm --filter @oppenheimer/api migration:run`).
  The organization/admin operations are exposed to the frontend through the Better
  Auth `organizationClient()` / `adminClient()` plugins (already wired into the web
  and mobile auth clients), not the generated api-client.

### Patch Changes

- a93cf5d: Refresh dependencies and pin the versions that must move together.

  Every package is updated within its semver range, plus a set of majors that
  carry no API change for this codebase: `@sentry/nestjs` 10, `pino-http` 11,
  `@bull-board/*` 8, `nodemailer` 9, `resend` 6, `inversify` 8,
  `dependency-cruiser` 18, `testcontainers` 12 and `@commitlint/*` 21.

  Three pins are added to `pnpm.overrides`, each for a resolution that the
  update would otherwise get wrong:

  - `react-native` — the mobile design system declares it as an unbounded
    `>=0.81.0` peer with no devDependency, so it re-resolved to 0.86 while both
    Expo apps pin 0.81.5. Two copies of React Native meant two incompatible
    copies of its types, and `@oppenheimer/design-system-mobile` stopped building.
  - `@nestjs/swagger` — 11.4.3 added an `exports` map that no longer exposes
    `dist/services/schema-object-factory`, which `nestjs-zod@4` deep-imports.
    Nothing catches this at build or test time; the API simply fails to boot.
    11.4.2 is the ceiling until the `zod` 4 / `nestjs-zod` 5 migration lands.

  Two unrelated robustness fixes in the auth layer, both found while verifying
  the upgrade against a live stack:

  - The standalone BullMQ email queue had no `error` listener. A queue is an
    EventEmitter, so a Redis restart or failover would raise an unhandled
    `error` event and take the API process down.
  - The `welcome` email enqueue in Better Auth's `user.create.after` hook was
    the only unguarded operation in a hook the surrounding code documents as
    best-effort. Better Auth does not await that hook, so a queue failure
    escaped as an unhandled rejection instead of being logged.
