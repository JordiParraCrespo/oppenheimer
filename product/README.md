# Vision

Everything discussed while planning the platform, in the order it was
decided. Read `brief.html` for the one-page version, or the notes below
for the detail and sources.

| # | Note | What it settles |
|---|------|-----------------|
| 00 | [Vision and plan](00-vision-and-plan.md) | What we build, lessons from OpenClaw and Orca, layers, domain model, stack |
| 01 | [Terminal first](01-terminal-first.md) | The core primitive is a persistent PTY in the browser; how Orca's relay does it; subscription logins done legitimately |
| 02 | [Targets and GitHub auth](02-targets-and-github-auth.md) | Direct-machine vs isolated-VM targets; proxy-injected GitHub tokens as Claude Code on the web does it |
| 03 | [Machines and VM provisioning](03-machines-and-vm-provisioning.md) | herdr, the Actions runner registration design, Actuated, the Firecracker provisioner, service split, Go runner |
| 04 | [Security review](04-security-review.md) | 28 findings by trust boundary, Tailscale as an optional perimeter, the measured reference VM spec |
| 05 | [GitHub experience](05-github-experience.md) | Connect, start, review, PR, auto-fix, routines, environments, and what each piece costs |
| 06 | [Multiple accounts](06-multi-account.md) | How Orca handles several Claude, Codex, Kimi, OpenCode accounts and usage meters; our account model; macOS resolved |
| 07 | [MVP](07-mvp.md) | A personal workspace of sessions, each a KVM guest on the Hetzner host, each just a terminal; Codex first; hosted web control plane |
| 08 | [Reuse the GHA runner host](08-reuse-gha-runner.md) | The existing Go runner controller is most of the provisioner; what sessions add; libvirt first, Firecracker later; website and runners in different places over the tailnet |
| 09 | [GitHub App install](09-github-app-install.md) | Install the App, choose all or selected repositories; the installation is the access control; narrowed one-hour tokens per session |
| 10 | [Sleep, wake, and pricing](10-sleep-wake-and-pricing.md) | Suspend and hibernate tiers on libvirt and on AWS, GCP, Azure, Fly, Hetzner Cloud; what an AX42 host holds; sleeping sessions are free; pricing shape |
| 11 | [Workspace layout](11-workspace-layout.md) | One fixed place per repo, `main/` plus one worktree per session, as in Orca; three runtimes: Shared workspace VM, Clean VM, This machine (the Mac Studio with simulators) |
| 12 | [Lessons from Grok Bot](12-lessons-from-grok-bot.md) | A reconstructed desktop agent app: brokered descriptors with hints, resumable migration streams, recreate-with-data updates, disk pressure, epoch-guarded reconnects; what we do not take |
| versions/mvp/ | [MVP design](versions/mvp/README.md) | In-depth design of the MVP, one document per area, with its own decision log |

Decisions that changed along the way, so nobody is confused by an
earlier note:

- Note 00 proposed the Claude Agent SDK as the core. Note 01 replaced it
  with a raw terminal; the SDK is a later add-on for unattended runs.
- Note 00 proposed a Node runner. Note 03 changed it to a single static
  Go binary.
- Note 06 first flagged the macOS Keychain as a blocker for multiple
  Claude accounts; it then verified that Claude Code 2.1.144+ scopes the
  Keychain entry per config dir, so it is not.
- Note 07 was first written as a five-screen MVP, then cut to sessions
  only on direct machines, then, after seeing the console mockups,
  reset to sessions in VMs with repo, branch, and agent chosen at
  creation. The session view stays a terminal; the Agent SDK stays out.
- Note 04 first proposed one persistent home volume per target. After a
  review found that conflicted with running two accounts concurrently,
  notes 04, 06, and 07 now use one volume per account.
- Note 07 records the VM lifetime decision: pause while idle, resume on
  visit, destroy on close. The phase table in note 00 is superseded by
  the order of work in note 07.
- Note 07 chose Firecracker first. Note 08 replaced it with libvirt/KVM
  because an existing, hardened controller already runs that on the
  target host. Firecracker is now a later cold-start optimization.
- Notes 02 and 05 described Claude Code on the web's access model, where
  the user's OAuth grant reaches any repository the account can see and
  the App only adds webhooks. Note 09 chooses the stricter model: the
  App installation, with all or selected repositories, is the access
  control.
- Note 07's single "pause when idle" became note 10's three tiers,
  tuned to the real host (i7-6700, 64 GB, SATA SSD): pause in RAM after
  ten minutes, suspend to disk after two hours, hibernate after a day.
- Note 07 said a VM per session. Note 11 keeps that for Ephemeral
  sessions and makes Keep sessions worktrees inside one workspace VM per
  repo per host, so the worktree UX matches Orca and ten sessions on a
  repo share one clone, one setup, and one Docker daemon.
- Note 00 proposed Next.js for the web app. Note 07 §11 leaves the
  framework open with a recommendation for a Vite + React SPA; Next.js
  used as a client app is also fine. The firm point is only that the
  console is a real-time client, not a server-rendered site.
- Note 07's VM-based MVP is superseded by `versions/mvp/00-scope.md`: the MVP
  is Orca on the web without VMs, sessions directly on your own hosts,
  Claude Code first. The VM design is the slice after, not deleted.
- Sign-in was GitHub-only; it is now GitHub, Google, and email plus
  password on day one, with Connect GitHub as a separate step
  (`versions/mvp/00-scope.md`).
- Notes 00 and 07 and `versions/mvp/03-control-plane.md` said Hono plus
  Drizzle for the control plane. The code started from the Flama
  starter, so the control plane is NestJS plus TypeORM on Postgres, with
  Better Auth for identity. The modules and the data model are unchanged;
  only the framework is (`versions/mvp/03-control-plane.md`).
- The codebase keeps every app the starter ships (admin, mobile, CLI,
  MCP, showcases, Helm) from day one, so later slices need no porting.
  Only `api`, `web`, `runner`, `docs` and `e2e` are the MVP; the rest is
  carried, not built on, until its slice arrives (`AGENTS.md`).
- The personal workspace is a row in the starter's `organization` table
  with the account as its single owner member, created at sign-up. No
  roster, no invitations, no teams are exposed in the MVP
  (`versions/mvp/08-auth.md`).
- The MVP's out-list deferred signed auto-update. It is now in the MVP:
  a host that can only be updated by the user pasting the install command
  again does not survive the first ten hosts, and the protocol needs the
  update-required hint regardless. The runner self-updates from artifacts
  signed with an offline key whose public half is compiled into the
  binary, so the control plane offers versions and never supplies code
  (`versions/mvp/09-runner-install-and-update.md`, security finding F26).
