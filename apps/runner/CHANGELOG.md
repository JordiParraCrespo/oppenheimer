# @oppenheimer/runner

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- a880b19: Connecting a host is hardened. An unpaired host is refused a link and stops dialling. The pairing-token cap holds under concurrent mints, and `POST /v1/hosts/pairing` takes `replaces` to retire the token on screen in the same write. The owner is emailed when a machine pairs. The agent prompt is a short template around the install command. `runner uninstall --force` keeps the pairing when a session cannot be ended, and a re-run of the installer restarts the systemd unit on the new release.
- bbacd49: Build the runner ↔ control-plane link so a session can be created and run from the console.

  - API: `relay/` mounts the two sockets of the protocol on the API's own HTTP server — the runner link (`GET /api/v1/relay/runner`, boot assertion as bearer, hello/welcome, heartbeat → host presence, `events.append` → the session log, acked by key) and the browser attach socket (`GET /api/v1/relay/attach`, single-use ticket as the subprotocol, re-checked against the session and the workspace membership). `links/` holds the per-host link registry and the real `SessionDispatchPort`, replacing the pending adapter.
  - Runner: `internal/link` dials out with a per-dial EdDSA boot token, pins the control plane's key fingerprint from `welcome`, reconnects through the ladder with an epoch, streams PTY reads as attachment-id-prefixed frames and reports events with `<runId>:<n>` keys, resending what was not acked. `session.create` maps the structured launch onto the agent's argv through the catalog mirror; the sessions service gained `Stop` and a caller-provided id.
  - Web: `SessionStream` is the real transport over the attach socket, minting a fresh ticket per (re)connect; the terminal shows `offline` while the host holds no link.
  - Credentials: `credentials.token` is answered with a `credentials.grant` sealed to the host's key (Ed25519 → X25519, ephemeral ECDH, HKDF, AES-256-GCM); the runner's git credential helper pulls the token over the link, unseals it and holds it in memory until expiry or `credentials.revoke`. Hello reconciliation re-dispatches a launch the host never carried out and records stopped a session it lost. `attachment.credit` pauses PTY reads at 256 KB in flight; `host.preflight` and `host.update` are handled.
  - Shared: the protocol gains `welcome`, `session.stop`, `session.detach`, `command.failed`, `attachment.closed` and the attach socket's own vocabulary; `CacheService` gains `take()` (`GETDEL`).

- bb3c4e8: The runner logs each step of starting a session as `session.step`, with the time each took, and resends unacknowledged batches in the order it made them.

### Patch Changes

- e717f42: Harden the runner link. PTY bytes are no longer dropped when a queue fills,
  and the runner's writer sends control frames first, then takes attachments in
  turn, so one pane's output no longer delays another pane's echo. Both sides
  now ping every 15 s, a runner the control plane cannot write to is closed
  rather than skipped, and epochs keep rising across API restarts. The
  terminal's transport (`SessionStream`, the resize coalescer, the replay
  stream) moves from `apps/web` into `@oppenheimer/frontend-consumer`, behind
  `SessionsService.openStream` and `useSessionStream`.
- 81f0347: A session on a private repository clones, and a create survives the link dropping while it runs.
