# @oppenheimer/web-showcase

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 73ce336: Port the 2026-10-13 evening export: `BotExchange` and `ProposedFile` in the chat's cards, `ComposerApproval` fused onto the composer through its new `above` slot, `BotItem`'s `needsInput`, `SidebarProjectHeader`'s eyebrow tone and `marker`, `SidebarEmptyCard`, `TemplateTiles` and a centred `ChatEmptyState`.
- 663e8ed: The 2026-10-13 export's new components. Settings controls: `Switch`,
  `PillGroup` (one value or a set) and `NumberStepper`. Share: `PeoplePicker`
  with `PersonChip`, and `AccessList`. Plan: `MilestoneTimeline` and
  `MilestoneGlyph`, `FacetSelect`, `DateRangePicker`, `AreaChart` and
  `CalendarAccountList`. Employees: `BotItem` (and `SortableBotItem`),
  `AvatarPicker`, `RoutineCard`, `SettingsListRow`, `SettingsAddRow` and
  `SettingsTopBar`. The agent chat, one file per family of the Chat Components
  inventory: transcript, work and tools, cards, dividers and status, the
  composer stack, decisions, composer extras and the header. Adds the
  `--selected-fg` token and the `shimmer` and `caret` animations.
- d4606c6: Pull requests on the 2026-10-13 screens, without the chat and the review
  agent.

  - `@oppenheimer/shared`, `@oppenheimer/api`, `@oppenheimer/api-client`: a
    review's verdict is `comment`, `approve`, `approve_and_merge` or
    `request_changes`. `approve` only approves now; `approve_and_merge`
    merges at once when GitHub allows it and otherwise turns on GitHub's
    auto-merge, answering `{ merged, autoMerge }`. The queue is ordered by
    lane (Deep first) and then the longest wait, and the path to merge is
    three gates (checks, conflicts, merge).
  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-consumer`: `ReviewOutcome`; the activity read
    (`usePullRequestActivity`) is removed.
  - `@oppenheimer/web`: a pull request is Description and Changes (a link to
    `?view=briefing` opens the description); the queue filters by repository,
    Difficulty, Checks and Waiting, with `j`/`k`, Enter and `/`; Review opens
    the changes; Settings → Watched repositories is where watching is set.
  - `@oppenheimer/design-system-web`: `MergePath` is the one-row status strip;
    `PullRequestTable` folds in three widths (1080px, 720px); `ChipSelect`
    options take a `count`. `FactTile`, `FactGrid`, `DiffCommentLink` and the
    Stepper's horizontal orientation are removed.
  - `@oppenheimer/translations`: the new queue, review, Settings and toast
    copy; the briefing, rail, activity and lane-reason keys are removed.

### Patch Changes

- e711f5c: Add a host leads with the agent prompt, in onboarding and in the console's
  dialog, as the 2026-10-13 design export draws it.

  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-web`: `PairingChrome` is agent first: the agent
    prompt in a card with Copy prompt (its text behind a fold), the token line
    with "Install manually instead" across from it (the install command on
    one line with its Copy, and the installer's digest), and a Connection
    list — Runner installed with its version, then Host connected with the
    machine's name and OS. The two folds are `Disclosure`s; the chrome's
    root carries `data-layout`, and each part sizes itself from it, so
    `PairingToken`, `PairingInstruction` and `PairingStatus` lose their
    `layout` prop. `PairedMachine` gains `runnerVersion`.
  - `@oppenheimer/web`: the onboarding step puts Continue, Skip for now and
    its note on one row; the dialog's copy follows the export.
  - `@oppenheimer/design-system-web`: `Disclosure`'s doc no longer names Add
    a host.
  - `@oppenheimer/web-showcase`: the Add a host demo draws the same column.
  - `@oppenheimer/translations`: `hosts.pairing` gains `manual`,
    `manualLead`, `connection`, `installWaiting`,
    `installed` and `connected`; `copyPrompt` reads "Copy prompt";
    `copyCommand` and `inspect` are removed. `hosts.add.description`,
    `onboarding.flow.host.description` and `skipNote` follow the export.

- f09b6b3: Bots: a session a bot starts is one click away in its chat.

  - `@oppenheimer/backend-agents`: a tool's result may carry `data`, what the
    call made, which the model never reads; `tool.finished` hands it back. The
    Claude engine matches it to its call by Claude Code's `claudecode/toolUseId`,
    the OpenAI engine by the SDK's call id.
  - `@oppenheimer/shared`: `sessionId` on `BotMessageEvent`.
  - `@oppenheimer/api`: `start_session` says which session it started as data,
    not only in words. The tool step keeps it (`sessionId` on a step), and an
    approved call keeps it on the approval (`bot_approval."sessionId"`, migration
    `AddBotApprovalSession`) and on the event that reports the yes.
  - `@oppenheimer/api-client`: `sessionId` on `BotToolStepResponseDto` and
    `BotMessageEventResponseDto`.
  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-consumer`: `sessionId` on `BotToolStep`.
  - `@oppenheimer/design-system-web`: an `action` slot on `TraceStep` (at the
    end of the line, outside the fold's trigger) and on `TranscriptDivider`
    (after the label).
  - `@oppenheimer/web-showcase`: both slots in the chat demos.
  - `@oppenheimer/web`: a small Open session button, opening the session in a
    new tab, on the step of the call that started it and on the approval line.
  - `@oppenheimer/translations`: `bots.chat.openSession`.

- b39d40f: Claude Code's model list matches Claude's own picker: Opus 5.5, Fable 5.1, Sonnet 5.5 and Haiku 5.5, then Haiku 4.5, Sonnet 5, Opus 5, Fable 5, Opus 4.8, Opus 4.7, Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.6 behind a "More models" row in the engine button.
- fa1a47b: No page breadcrumbs in the console: a page under a parent opens on a Back
  pill alone.

  - `@oppenheimer/web`: a project's page opens with the Back pill to Projects
    instead of a breadcrumb; an automation, Add a host and a host's Desktop
    drop the breadcrumb under their Back pill.
  - `@oppenheimer/design-system-web`: `PageHeaderCrumbs` and `PageHeaderHere`
    are removed.
  - `@oppenheimer/web-showcase`: the PageHeader demos lose their crumbs.
  - `@oppenheimer/translations`: `common.breadcrumb`,
    `automations.detail.crumb` and `hosts.add.crumbHosts` are removed.

- a6d67d7: Plan's calendar and tasks follow the 2026-11-08 `Tasks` frame.

  - `@oppenheimer/web`: the calendar opens on Day, with Week and Month beside
    it (`?view=`, `?date=`): the hours from 07:00 to 22:00 under an All day
    row, where an event or a task due at a time is dropped on a half hour to
    move there, and an empty half hour opens New event at that time. Plan
    gains To do (`/plan/todo`), one day's tasks with what is overdue, ticked
    and added in place.
  - `@oppenheimer/design-system-web`: `AgendaCalendar` (with `agendaSlot` and
    `agendaSlotId`) and `TodoRow`, `TodoRowAdd`, `TodoRowSkeleton`;
    `MonthCalendar` takes `onOpenDay`.
  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-web`: `isoWeek`.
  - `@oppenheimer/translations`: `calendar.header` gains the views and the
    week eyebrows, `calendar.grid.allDay`; `tasks.nav.todo` and `tasks.todo`.
  - `@oppenheimer/web-showcase`: the AgendaCalendar and TodoRow demos.

- 9871b11: Plan's board drops the Later column and gains In review, between In
  progress and Done: `TASK_STATUSES` is `todo`, `doing`, `review`, `done`.
  A migration moves every task in Later to the end of To do, in its order,
  and bumps its version. Attaching a session still moves a task in To do to
  In progress. The CLI's and MCP server's status choices, the bots' plan
  tools and `tasks.columns` follow.
- 0079b26: To do's rows reorder by dragging the six-dot grip at their right end; the
  order is kept per day on this device.

  - `@oppenheimer/design-system-web`: `SortableTodoRow`; `TodoRow` draws its
    `children` last on the row.
  - `@oppenheimer/translations`: `tasks.todo.reorder`.
  - `@oppenheimer/web-showcase`: the To do demo reorders.

- fe61b51: Sharing a session follows the `ShareSession` design
  (`product/versions/mvp/21-session-share-links.md`): one share per session
  at one address, `/s/<slug>`, for named people or anyone signed in; view, or
  write for named people for 24 hours at most. The Share dialog opens from a
  row's menu and the terminal's status line, and the guest page is one bar
  and the terminal. The share-link routes are replaced by
  `GET`/`PUT`/`DELETE /v1/sessions/{id}/share` and
  `PATCH /v1/sessions/{id}/share/people`; existing links are dropped. The
  design system gains `RadioGroupCard` (with `columns` on `RadioGroup`) and an
  `actions` slot on `SessionPaneHeader`.
- 8283986: To do's rows are picked up by the pointer anywhere on the card, not only by
  the six-dot grip; the done toggle never lifts the row, and a press on the
  title that moves under 5px is still a click that opens the task. The grip stays the keyboard's handle and,
  on a touch screen, the part that drags instead of scrolling.

  - `@oppenheimer/design-system-web`: `useSortableItem` returns its
    `listeners`, so a surface can put the pointer's on a box bigger than the
    handle; `SortableTodoRow` puts it on the row.
  - `@oppenheimer/web-showcase`: the TodoRow entry says so.

- a69aa94: TODO knows about agents (`product/versions/mvp/20-plan-calendar.md` §6,
  "Changed on 2026-11-12").

  - `@oppenheimer/web`: a task on TODO that an agent is working on (a session
    running or queued, none waiting on the person) moves to a "With agents"
    section under the list, with its session's chip; the others with sessions
    stay on the list marked waiting on you, failed, ready to review (the In
    review column only) or agent stopped. The header's "left" and the
    sidebar's TODO count leave out what is with agents. Each open row has a
    Move button (Tomorrow, or a day picked on a month) that sets its TODO
    day, except a task its deadline holds on the day shown.
  - `@oppenheimer/design-system-web`: `DatePicker` takes the caller's own
    trigger as `children` (an `IconButton` on a row); the month and the quick
    picks are the same.
  - `@oppenheimer/translations`: the board's first column reads "Not started"
    ("Sin empezar"), the dialog's day field "TODO day" ("Día en TODO"), and
    "on TODO since {{date}}"; `tasks.todo` gains `withAgents`, `mark.*`,
    `move`, `moveTitle` and `moveFailed`.
  - `@oppenheimer/web-showcase`: the board's first column is Not started, and
    the DatePicker spec shows an icon trigger.
  - `@oppenheimer/shared`: the bots' bundled guide follows the user guide's
    TODO page.

- 27f034a: The wordmark stands alone: the console's brand row and the auth and public
  pages show "Oppenheimer" without the "Console" suffix. `Wordmark` loses its
  `product` prop, `BrandLogo` is gone (the auth and public chrome draw
  `Wordmark` directly), `AuthLayout` loses its `product` prop, and the
  `common.product` key is gone from the catalogs.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 9431938: The design system draws a session's host going offline and coming back
  (a banner in the status bar's place by default, a card over the scrollback
  as the other form), the command to copy that brings it back, an offline
  host's detail on Settings, and a pane that takes dropped files.
- 08d42f1: A generic drag layer, and Plan in the design system: the task board and
  goals, the month calendar, the date picker and the session pane's header.
  `PageHeaderRow` takes a `display` size.
- 121d28a: Pull requests in the design system: the queue, a pull request's briefing
  and review decision, the diff with its comments and file tree (on
  @pierre/diffs and @pierre/trees), file-type marks, the review analytics'
  charts, and a rail the reader can reorder. `SegmentedControl` takes `md`
  and `lg` sizes and item counts; `StatusDot` gains the gate states
  `passing`, `blocked` and `waiting`; `Badge` gains `strong` and `soft`;
  `Stepper` lays out horizontally; `RadioGroup` is new; the dark chart teal and violet moved to
  pass colour-blind separation.

### Patch Changes

- c983201: The sidebar's sessions reorder by dragging, inside a project or into another
  one (`SortableSessionItem`). A sortable row that is also a link picks up on
  Space so Enter still opens it, and the screen reader is told so
  (`useSortableControl`).
- c05c4ff: - The shell frames a page at the route's measure: `staticData.pane` is a size
  of `EditorPageBody`, or `full`. `measure` is gone.
  - `EditorPageBody` takes `size` instead of `wide`; `TaskBoard`'s `gutter` prop
    is gone.
- 473557a: - `EditorPageBody`'s `size` is a measure the export repeats: `status`,
  `composer`, `narrow`, `wide`, `board`, `fluid`. A child opts in to the
  frame's edge with `data-bleed`.
  - The shell frames the page; `EditorPage` paints no ground.
  - `staticData.pane` may be a function of the route's search.
  - The kit adds `PaneBar` and `usePaneDrop`; the design system exports
    `DropOutline`.
- c237a5f: The console's sidebar reorders by dragging: a project by its header among
  the others (`SortableSidebarProjectGroup`), and a session within its project
  or into another one, which moves it there. The order is kept on the device,
  and the sort menu gains Custom order, its new default.
  `useSortableGroups` tells `onChange` when a drag settles and hands `onMove`
  the value it settled on; a session write stays pending until the session
  lists have refetched.
