# @oppenheimer/web

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 24d217d: Add host is a dialog in the console.

  - `@oppenheimer/web`: New session's host chip opens the Add host dialog instead
    of navigating to `/onboarding/host`; the dialog owns the Command / Agent
    prompt switch, the panel and a footer that arms on a registered host.
  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-web`: new `hosts` concern with `HostPairingChrome` —
    the token line and the status row the onboarding step and the dialog both
    draw.
  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-consumer`: `useHostPairing` (in `react/hosts.pairing.ts`)
    is the pairing flow both surfaces run; it counts `secondsLeft` rather than
    formatting a clock. `useCurrentPairing`, `usePairingTokens` and `useHosts`'s
    poll are its internals and leave the barrel; the unused `usePairHost` is gone.
  - `@oppenheimer/translations`: new `hosts` namespace for the pairing copy both
    surfaces read, `sessions.new.addHost.*` for the dialog's own words, and
    `common.close`.

- 5bd4a8b: New session sets how a session is launched, and `POST /sessions` takes it.

  The route grows a `launch` object — model, permission level, effort — and the
  `prompt` typed into the composer. The launch is folded onto `work_session` so a
  restart can relaunch a session the way it was launched without walking its log.
  The prompt is a log entry and rides `session.create` to the host, where it
  becomes the agent's trailing argument rather than something typed at a running
  terminal — so nothing about the composer waits on the relay, and exactly one of
  the two ends ever writes `prompt.first`. It also names the session, through a
  new `openai-compatible` namer provider that covers Groq, Together, vLLM and a
  local Ollama.

  The agent catalog in `@oppenheimer/shared` grows each agent's models and the
  argv its permission levels, effort stops and first task map to, read off
  claude 2.1.278's and codex-cli 0.155.1's own `--help`.

  **Breaking, `@oppenheimer/frontend-consumer`:** `SessionEntity` was modelling one
  repository, one branch and a `running | idle | stopped` state the control plane
  had stopped sending. It carries `checkouts`, the derived `state` group and the
  stored `lifecycle` now, and `create` takes an idempotency key from its caller.

- 1ad71b4: The create-key dialog takes the per-row permission picker, so a click no longer re-renders every toggle, and the search field keeps the half-typed word while the settled query drives the filter.
- bbacd49: Build the runner ↔ control-plane link so a session can be created and run from the console.

  - API: `relay/` mounts the two sockets of the protocol on the API's own HTTP server — the runner link (`GET /api/v1/relay/runner`, boot assertion as bearer, hello/welcome, heartbeat → host presence, `events.append` → the session log, acked by key) and the browser attach socket (`GET /api/v1/relay/attach`, single-use ticket as the subprotocol, re-checked against the session and the workspace membership). `links/` holds the per-host link registry and the real `SessionDispatchPort`, replacing the pending adapter.
  - Runner: `internal/link` dials out with a per-dial EdDSA boot token, pins the control plane's key fingerprint from `welcome`, reconnects through the ladder with an epoch, streams PTY reads as attachment-id-prefixed frames and reports events with `<runId>:<n>` keys, resending what was not acked. `session.create` maps the structured launch onto the agent's argv through the catalog mirror; the sessions service gained `Stop` and a caller-provided id.
  - Web: `SessionStream` is the real transport over the attach socket, minting a fresh ticket per (re)connect; the terminal shows `offline` while the host holds no link.
  - Credentials: `credentials.token` is answered with a `credentials.grant` sealed to the host's key (Ed25519 → X25519, ephemeral ECDH, HKDF, AES-256-GCM); the runner's git credential helper pulls the token over the link, unseals it and holds it in memory until expiry or `credentials.revoke`. Hello reconciliation re-dispatches a launch the host never carried out and records stopped a session it lost. `attachment.credit` pauses PTY reads at 256 KB in flight; `host.preflight` and `host.update` are handled.
  - Shared: the protocol gains `welcome`, `session.stop`, `session.detach`, `command.failed`, `attachment.closed` and the attach socket's own vocabulary; `CacheService` gains `take()` (`GETDEL`).

- 8fab63d: Add server-evaluated feature flags, wired into the API and the console.

  Flags are declared in code, targeted in the database, evaluated on the server
  and read on every client from one endpoint — the shape Stripe and Revolut
  describe for their own. Ported from the Flama starter.

  - **`@oppenheimer/shared`** gains `feature-flags/`: the `FEATURE_FLAGS` catalog
    (every flag the code may read, with its kind, owner, safe default and — for
    temporary flags — expiry), the pure evaluator (ordered rules, segments,
    semver targeting on the app build, deterministic MurmurHash3 percentage
    splits bucketed by organization), and the Zod schemas for targeting writes.
    Like `agents` and `protocol` it is reached through its own subpaths, not the
    root barrel: `@oppenheimer/shared/feature-flags`, and the Zod-free
    `@oppenheimer/shared/feature-flags/catalog` for the web bundle. A `flags`
    scope group, a `FeatureFlag` subject and a `GET /feature-flags/admin`
    endpoint policy join the catalogs.
  - **`@oppenheimer/api`** gains a `feature-flags` module. Every replica holds
    all targeting in memory and evaluates without I/O, polling a cheap
    fingerprint to stay in sync and keeping its last good snapshot through a
    database blip. `GET /v1/feature-flags` serves the caller's evaluated client
    flags (signed out too); the endpoints under `/v1/feature-flags/admin`,
    `/segments` and `/changes` edit targeting, pull kill switches, manage
    segments, explain an evaluation and read the audit trail, which every change
    lands on through the outbox. `@RequireFlag('key')` gates a route on a flag,
    and token creation is now behind the `api_token_creation` kill switch. New
    error codes `FLAG_001`–`FLAG_007`. Migration `AddFeatureFlags`, every point
    in time `timestamptz`.
  - **`@oppenheimer/api-client`**: the regenerated client carries the feature
    flag operations and DTOs.
  - **`@oppenheimer/frontend-core`**: a `feature-flags` kernel module and
    `useFeatureFlag` / `useFeatureFlagValue` / `useFeatureFlags`, typed by the
    catalog, reading the API rather than PostHog. Flags are prefetched as soon as
    the session is known, persisted with the query cache, and an `experiment`
    flag records a `feature_flag_exposed` event. `OppenheimerApp.create` takes
    `featureFlags: { platform, appVersion }`.

    **Breaking:** feature flags leave the analytics port. `IAnalyticsClient` no
    longer has `getFeatureFlags` / `onFeatureFlags`, `AnalyticsService` no longer
    serves flags, `analyticsKeys.flags` is gone, and `isFlagEnabled` moved to the
    `feature-flags` module. `useFeatureFlag(key)` keeps its name but now takes a
    catalog key and reads the server's answer.

  - **`@oppenheimer/frontend-web`**: the PostHog adapter drops its flag methods
    and switches PostHog's own flag loading off.
  - **`@oppenheimer/translations`**: messages for `FLAG_001`–`FLAG_007`, and the
    control-plane copy for a flags screen (`control.flags`, `nav.featureFlags`).
  - **`@oppenheimer/web`** reports its platform and build when it asks for its
    flags.

  `pnpm check:flags` (in CI) fails on a temporary flag past its expiry date and
  on a flag the catalog declares but no code reads.

- 487c718: The session terminal keeps the agent's prompt on the pane's last rows.

  In the agent's window Shift+Enter is a newline in the prompt; Ctrl+C copies a selection, and Ctrl+Shift+V pastes.

- 1a51afc: Serve the built SPAs with gzip, `immutable` caching on hashed assets and a real CSP; prefetch route chunks on intent, issue the session lookup from `<head>`, split vendor chunks per library, and fail `pnpm check:bundle` past a committed budget.
- bb3c4e8: Starting a session shows the host's steps as the design export draws them.

### Patch Changes

- e717f42: Harden the runner link. PTY bytes are no longer dropped when a queue fills,
  and the runner's writer sends control frames first, then takes attachments in
  turn, so one pane's output no longer delays another pane's echo. Both sides
  now ping every 15 s, a runner the control plane cannot write to is closed
  rather than skipped, and epochs keep rising across API restarts. The
  terminal's transport (`SessionStream`, the resize coalescer, the replay
  stream) moves from `apps/web` into `@oppenheimer/frontend-consumer`, behind
  `SessionsService.openStream` and `useSessionStream`.
- f099524: Auth forms run through React Hook Form: per-field errors inline, and no submit until the whole form parses.
- f099524: Read the root `.env` via Vite's `envDir`; a `.env` inside the app directory is no longer read.
- f099524: Take the Better Auth configuration from `@oppenheimer/auth` instead of a local copy.
- f099524: Follow the `@oppenheimer/config` → `@oppenheimer/tsconfig` rename.
- b9fb2ce: Put the sign-in screens and the first-run steps under one `_auth` layout, with
  the guard on each subtree rather than the shared shell, and fold the
  create-workspace screen at `/onboarding` into the step that already names one:
  `/onboarding` is the door to the walk, and `claimPersonalWorkspace` creates
  when there is no row to name. Every URL is unchanged.
- ed28ce2: The repository chip holds one repository, and a start refused with `SESS_002` says the host makes sessions with one repository.
- a0fdce4: The terminal's session streams are classes: `AttachSessionStream` for the attach socket and `FakeSessionStream` for the replay, both behind the `SessionStream` interface.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- e209380: Add a CLI and an MCP server, both governed by granular per-credential
  permissions.

  Authorization gains a second layer. Roles say what a _person_ may do; **scopes**
  say what a _credential_ may do on their behalf, and the two are intersected on
  every request. A token can never be minted with more reach than its creator
  has, and revoking someone's role immediately narrows every credential they
  issued.

  - **`@oppenheimer/shared`**: the scope catalog — nine permission groups
    (profile, users, admin, roles, organizations, members, invitations,
    workspaces, tokens), each with a Read and an Edit level backed by the CASL
    rules it authorizes. Helpers for parsing, the write ⇒ read implication, the
    OAuth string form, and `grantableScopes`/`ungrantableScopes`, which enforce
    the "never exceed your creator" rule. Plus `ResourceScope` for per-organization
    narrowing, Zod schemas for token creation, and an `ApiToken` subject with
    own-token permissions on the seeded `user` role.

  - **`@oppenheimer/api`**: a new `api-tokens` DDD module (Better Auth 1.6 no longer
    ships an apiKey plugin). Only a SHA-256 digest of each secret is stored;
    tokens support expiry, IP allowlists and organization scoping, and are revoked
    rather than deleted. `ApiAuthGuard` replaces Better Auth's cookie-only guard
    and accepts a session cookie, an API token or an OAuth access token;
    `ScopesGuard` is registered globally and fails closed, so a route that
    declares no `@RequireScopes` cannot be reached by a token at all. The MCP
    plugin adds OAuth 2.1 discovery, dynamic client registration and a consent
    page. New endpoints: `GET|POST /v1/tokens`, `DELETE /v1/tokens/:id`,
    `GET /v1/tokens/permissions` and `GET /v1/me/credential`.

  - **`@oppenheimer/mcp`** (new): an MCP server exposing 26 tools over stdio and
    Streamable HTTP from one registry. Tools declare the scopes they need and the
    tool list is filtered by the credential's effective scopes, so an agent is
    never shown a capability that would be refused.

  - **`@oppenheimer/cli`** (new): `oppenheimer` — login that trades a session for a scoped
    token, token management with a permission catalog, users/roles/orgs/workspaces
    commands, `--json` output, profiles, and `oppenheimer mcp install` to connect an
    agent.

  - **`@oppenheimer/web`** / **`@oppenheimer/frontend-consumer`**: a
    token-creation screen with a per-resource permission picker (levels you cannot
    grant are disabled) and an OAuth consent screen, backed by new `api-tokens`
    and `organizations` modules with TanStack Query hooks.

  Deploying runs a migration that adds the `api_token` and OAuth tables and grants
  every user permission over their own tokens. `pnpm generate:api-client` no
  longer needs a running database.
