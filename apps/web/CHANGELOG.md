# @oppenheimer/web

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 1ad71b4: The create-key dialog takes the per-row permission picker, so a click no longer re-renders every toggle, and the search field keeps the half-typed word while the settled query drives the filter.
- 1a51afc: Serve the built SPAs with gzip, `immutable` caching on hashed assets and a real CSP; prefetch route chunks on intent, issue the session lookup from `<head>`, split vendor chunks per library, and fail `pnpm check:bundle` past a committed budget.

### Patch Changes

- f099524: Auth forms run through React Hook Form: per-field errors inline, and no submit until the whole form parses.
- f099524: Read the root `.env` via Vite's `envDir`; a `.env` inside the app directory is no longer read.
- f099524: Take the Better Auth configuration from `@oppenheimer/auth` instead of a local copy.
- f099524: Follow the `@oppenheimer/config` → `@oppenheimer/tsconfig` rename.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- e209380: Add a CLI and an MCP server, both governed by granular per-credential
  permissions.

  Authorization gains a second layer. Roles say what a _person_ may do; **scopes**
  say what a _credential_ may do on their behalf, and the two are intersected on
  every request. A token can never be minted with more reach than its creator
  has, and revoking someone's role immediately narrows every credential they
  issued.

  - **`@oppenheimer/shared`**: the scope catalog — nine permission groups
    (profile, users, admin, roles, organizations, members, invitations,
    workspaces, tokens), each with a Read and an Edit level backed by the CASL
    rules it authorizes. Helpers for parsing, the write ⇒ read implication, the
    OAuth string form, and `grantableScopes`/`ungrantableScopes`, which enforce
    the "never exceed your creator" rule. Plus `ResourceScope` for per-organization
    narrowing, Zod schemas for token creation, and an `ApiToken` subject with
    own-token permissions on the seeded `user` role.

  - **`@oppenheimer/api`**: a new `api-tokens` DDD module (Better Auth 1.6 no longer
    ships an apiKey plugin). Only a SHA-256 digest of each secret is stored;
    tokens support expiry, IP allowlists and organization scoping, and are revoked
    rather than deleted. `ApiAuthGuard` replaces Better Auth's cookie-only guard
    and accepts a session cookie, an API token or an OAuth access token;
    `ScopesGuard` is registered globally and fails closed, so a route that
    declares no `@RequireScopes` cannot be reached by a token at all. The MCP
    plugin adds OAuth 2.1 discovery, dynamic client registration and a consent
    page. New endpoints: `GET|POST /v1/tokens`, `DELETE /v1/tokens/:id`,
    `GET /v1/tokens/permissions` and `GET /v1/me/credential`.

  - **`@oppenheimer/mcp`** (new): an MCP server exposing 26 tools over stdio and
    Streamable HTTP from one registry. Tools declare the scopes they need and the
    tool list is filtered by the credential's effective scopes, so an agent is
    never shown a capability that would be refused.

  - **`@oppenheimer/cli`** (new): `oppenheimer` — login that trades a session for a scoped
    token, token management with a permission catalog, users/roles/orgs/workspaces
    commands, `--json` output, profiles, and `oppenheimer mcp install` to connect an
    agent.

  - **`@oppenheimer/web`** / **`@oppenheimer/frontend-consumer`**: a
    token-creation screen with a per-resource permission picker (levels you cannot
    grant are disabled) and an OAuth consent screen, backed by new `api-tokens`
    and `organizations` modules with TanStack Query hooks.

  Deploying runs a migration that adds the `api_token` and OAuth tables and grants
  every user permission over their own tokens. `pnpm generate:api-client` no
  longer needs a running database.
