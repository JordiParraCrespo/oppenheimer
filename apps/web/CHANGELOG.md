# @oppenheimer/web

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- e711f5c: Add a host leads with the agent prompt, in onboarding and in the console's
  dialog, as the 2026-10-13 design export draws it.

  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-web`: `PairingChrome` is agent first: the agent
    prompt in a card with Copy prompt (its text behind a fold), the token line
    with "Install manually instead" across from it (the install command on
    one line with its Copy, and the installer's digest), and a Connection
    list — Runner installed with its version, then Host connected with the
    machine's name and OS. The two folds are `Disclosure`s; the chrome's
    root carries `data-layout`, and each part sizes itself from it, so
    `PairingToken`, `PairingInstruction` and `PairingStatus` lose their
    `layout` prop. `PairedMachine` gains `runnerVersion`.
  - `@oppenheimer/web`: the onboarding step puts Continue, Skip for now and
    its note on one row; the dialog's copy follows the export.
  - `@oppenheimer/design-system-web`: `Disclosure`'s doc no longer names Add
    a host.
  - `@oppenheimer/web-showcase`: the Add a host demo draws the same column.
  - `@oppenheimer/translations`: `hosts.pairing` gains `manual`,
    `manualLead`, `connection`, `installWaiting`,
    `installed` and `connected`; `copyPrompt` reads "Copy prompt";
    `copyCommand` and `inspect` are removed. `hosts.add.description`,
    `onboarding.flow.host.description` and `skipNote` follow the export.

- 39dbe36: Bots, the Needs input card (`product/versions/mvp/25-bots.md` §5).

  - `@oppenheimer/shared`: `BOT_APPROVAL_STATUSES`, `decideBotApprovalSchema`,
    `findBotApprovalsSchema`, the `event` message role and the `approval`
    stream event.
  - `@oppenheimer/api`: `bot_approval`; under Approve for me an asking tool's
    call becomes a pending approval (one per bot) instead of running;
    `GET /v1/bots/:id/approvals` and
    `POST /v1/bots/:id/approvals/:approvalId/decision`, which runs the stored
    call as the owner on a yes and queues a turn opened by an `event` message
    either way; a new message expires the card. Errors `BOTS_015`, `BOTS_016`.
  - `@oppenheimer/api-client`: the approval operations.
  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-consumer`: approvals on the bots repository and their
    hooks.
  - `@oppenheimer/web`: the Needs input card above the composer, and the event
    line in the transcript.
  - `@oppenheimer/translations`: the card's copy and `errors.byCode.BOTS_015`–`BOTS_016`.

- ac929fa: Bots on a ChatGPT subscription (`product/versions/mvp/25-bots.md` §2): a fourth
  provider, `chatgpt`, signed in rather than given a key, the way OpenClaw and the
  Codex CLI do it.

  - Settings → Model providers has a ChatGPT row with Connect ChatGPT: OpenAI's
    device code flow, a one-time code typed on OpenAI's page, polled until the
    person approves it (`POST /v1/model-providers/chatgpt/login` and
    `…/login/poll`). The sign-in's tokens are sealed like a key.
  - `ChatgptBotEngine`, the OpenAI engine with ChatGPT's Codex backend as its
    endpoint: the account header, `store: false` and encrypted reasoning.
  - The worker refreshes the token before a turn when it is about to lapse, one
    refresh per workspace at a time, written only over the tokens it read; a
    refresh ChatGPT refuses removes the sign-in.
  - New problems `BOTS_017`–`BOTS_021`; `PUT /model-providers/chatgpt` answers
    `BOTS_017`.

- a80436f: A project may hold no repository. It is a place for tasks, milestones,
  memory and sessions before it is a set of repositories, and folder and
  terminal sessions need none.

  - `@oppenheimer/shared`: `projectRepositoriesSchema` accepts an empty list;
    a default is required only when the project holds a repository.
  - `@oppenheimer/api`: the project aggregate and `PROJECTS_006` no longer
    refuse an empty list. The code still names a list with no default, a
    repository twice, more than twenty, or a blank base branch.
  - `@oppenheimer/web`: the project dialog saves a named project with no
    repository, and removing the last repository sends an empty list.
  - `@oppenheimer/translations`: `errors.byCode.PROJECTS_006` reads the rule
    as it now is.

- d4606c6: Pull requests on the 2026-10-13 screens, without the chat and the review
  agent.

  - `@oppenheimer/shared`, `@oppenheimer/api`, `@oppenheimer/api-client`: a
    review's verdict is `comment`, `approve`, `approve_and_merge` or
    `request_changes`. `approve` only approves now; `approve_and_merge`
    merges at once when GitHub allows it and otherwise turns on GitHub's
    auto-merge, answering `{ merged, autoMerge }`. The queue is ordered by
    lane (Deep first) and then the longest wait, and the path to merge is
    three gates (checks, conflicts, merge).
  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-consumer`: `ReviewOutcome`; the activity read
    (`usePullRequestActivity`) is removed.
  - `@oppenheimer/web`: a pull request is Description and Changes (a link to
    `?view=briefing` opens the description); the queue filters by repository,
    Difficulty, Checks and Waiting, with `j`/`k`, Enter and `/`; Review opens
    the changes; Settings → Watched repositories is where watching is set.
  - `@oppenheimer/design-system-web`: `MergePath` is the one-row status strip;
    `PullRequestTable` folds in three widths (1080px, 720px); `ChipSelect`
    options take a `count`. `FactTile`, `FactGrid`, `DiffCommentLink` and the
    Stepper's horizontal orientation are removed.
  - `@oppenheimer/translations`: the new queue, review, Settings and toast
    copy; the briefing, rail, activity and lane-reason keys are removed.

- 6917f62: Review sessions: a pull request's Chat tab starts Claude Code on one of your hosts, in a worktree of its head branch, on a review prompt that opens with a two-or-three-line take, then shows its terminal with an input line under it. Review sessions are listed under For review in the Pull requests sidebar and left out of Sessions (`origin = 'review'`, `pull_request_review_session`). New routes: `POST /pulls/…/review-session` and `GET /pulls/review-sessions`; a fork's pull request is `PULLS_002`. The pull request detail says whether its head is in a fork (`fromFork`).
- 11fa44a: Deleting a session feels immediate, and a session gone from its host no
  longer gets stuck.

  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-consumer`, `@oppenheimer/web`: the sidebar drops a
    session the moment Delete is confirmed and keeps it out until its host
    resolves it. The row comes back when the close cannot happen: the API
    refuses it, the host is offline (`SESSIONS_CLIENT_019`, shown in the
    dialog), or the host has not resolved it within a minute. The "asked the
    host to delete" toast is gone. A restart's watch also ends when the
    session resolves.
  - `@oppenheimer/runner`: a close or a restart for a session this host holds
    no record of, one already closed here, or one whose worktree was deleted
    by hand closes it and reports `session.closed`, so its row resolves. A
    restart of such a session is still refused.
  - `@oppenheimer/translations`: `errors.byCode.SESSIONS_CLIENT_019`; the
    `toasts.sessionDeleteRequested` key is removed.

- 45d642b: A session runs in a new worktree or in a folder already on the host
  (`product/versions/mvp/24-session-places.md`).

  - `@oppenheimer/runner`: the work folder is `~/oppenheimer/<account>/<workspace>/{repos,
agents, sessions}`, with bare stores and a `.oppenheimer/` marker in every
    folder the runner makes; a folder session runs in the person's folder and
    writes nothing there; `fs.list` lists a host's directories. The old
    `~/oppenheimer-ai/workspaces` layout is not migrated.
  - `@oppenheimer/shared`: `session.create` carries the account and workspace
    ids and either checkouts or a `folder`; `fs.list` / `fs.listing`; the
    `session.folder` and `fs.list` capabilities; `createSessionSchema` takes a
    `folder` instead of checkouts.
  - `@oppenheimer/api`: `work_session` records the place and the folder;
    `GET /v1/hosts/{id}/folders` lists a folder through the runner with the
    caller's recent folders; `SESSIONS_025`–`031`.
  - `@oppenheimer/web`: New session's Where chip (New worktree, Folder on
    host), the folder picker, Open terminal on a host in Settings, folder and
    terminal icons in the sidebar. The permission level opens on `auto` and is
    remembered.
  - `@oppenheimer/design-system-web`: `Composer` takes `allowEmpty`, so a
    blank terminal can start with no first task.

- fe61b51: Sharing a session follows the `ShareSession` design
  (`product/versions/mvp/21-session-share-links.md`): one share per session
  at one address, `/s/<slug>`, for named people or anyone signed in; view, or
  write for named people for 24 hours at most. The Share dialog opens from a
  row's menu and the terminal's status line, and the guest page is one bar
  and the terminal. The share-link routes are replaced by
  `GET`/`PUT`/`DELETE /v1/sessions/{id}/share` and
  `PATCH /v1/sessions/{id}/share/people`; existing links are dropped. The
  design system gains `RadioGroupCard` (with `columns` on `RadioGroup`) and an
  `actions` slot on `SessionPaneHeader`.
- 13374f0: A session's terminal can take a direct path to its host
  (`product/versions/mvp/22-direct-terminal-path.md`), behind the new
  `terminal_direct_path` release flag.

  - `@oppenheimer/runner`: answers a browser's WebRTC offer with pion and
    carries the attachment's bytes on one ordered `pty` data channel, at most
    eight per host; switches each direction at a byte offset; falls back to the
    link when the channel closes, with the tmux client repainted. The hello
    names `attachment.direct`.
  - `@oppenheimer/api`: the relay offers a direct path (with
    `RELAY_ICE_SERVERS`) to a runner that can answer, for a person the flag is
    on for, outside share links, and forwards the offer, answer, refusal and
    offsets.
  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-consumer`: the attach stream opens the data channel
    beside its socket when invited, switches at the offsets, follows a
    fallback, and stops trying after two failed channels; `onPath` says which
    path the bytes take.
  - `@oppenheimer/web`: the latency readout names the path.
  - `@oppenheimer/shared`: the signalling messages on both sockets, the
    `attachment.direct` capability and the `terminal_direct_path` flag.

- a68c88c: The session terminal predicts what you type.

  - `@oppenheimer/web`: predictive local echo. A character typed at the cursor,
    Backspace, Left and Right are drawn at once in an overlay over the grid and
    dropped the moment the host's output disagrees; Up, Down, Enter and every
    other key go to the program unpredicted and start a new epoch, whose first
    key waits for the host (so a prompt that does not echo, a password, is never
    drawn). It draws only while the measured keystroke round trip is above
    30 ms. The round trip is measured in the browser, and setting
    `localStorage['oppenheimer.terminal.latency'] = '1'` shows it in the pane's
    corner as `echo p50 / p95 ms`.
  - `@oppenheimer/shared`: the `terminal_typeahead` flag, an `ops` kill switch,
    on by default.

### Patch Changes

- 50429c4: A bot's effort saves once per adjustment, when its picker closes, instead of once per stop the knob crosses, which a drag across the track turned into a burst of updates the API refused as too many requests. `EffortPicker` takes an optional `onOpenChange` so the caller can tell when it closes.
- 3a3b09d: The web image's nginx looks the API up by name every few seconds instead of
  once at start, and retries a request on another API container when one
  refuses it, so it follows an API replaced without downtime.
  `NGINX_RESOLVER` (Docker's embedded DNS by default) names the resolver.
- 82411a9: The session terminal's cursor is a text field's caret: a one-pixel bar,
  focused or not, instead of a block (a hollow block when the pane is not
  focused). A program can still ask for another shape. A predicted cursor draws
  as the same bar while the program shows the terminal's cursor, and as a block
  where the program paints its own (Claude Code's inverse cell).
- 05a6f99: The session terminal's cursor is a block again: the one-pixel bar was too thin
  to find. A predicted cursor draws as the same block.
- 5ea0fa7: The session terminal's cursor no longer blinks while typing ahead of the host.
  Each echo cleared the predicted cursor at once, while the terminal's own
  cursor came back only once xterm had parsed its show, so every key left a
  frame with no cursor at all. The predicted cursor now stays until the
  terminal's is back.
- 8769c3f: A predicted letter is drawn where the host's echo will draw it. The
  overlay laid its glyphs out as CSS text with an estimated padding, which put
  them a pixel or two above xterm's own (by face and pixel ratio), so each letter
  visibly dropped into place when the echo arrived. It now draws the way the
  renderer in use does: on a canvas with the WebGL renderer's own baseline rule,
  or as CSS text laid out like the DOM renderer's rows.
- f68f9b8: Holding Backspace in a Claude Code session no longer deletes the `❯` prompt
  for a moment. Claude Code draws the prompt as `❯` and a no-break space, which
  the typeahead read as text, so a guessed Backspace went through the prompt
  until the host refused it and the line sprang back. Any space now ends a
  prompt mark.
- e0e5305: Typing ahead of a slow host shows one cursor. While a prediction is drawn the
  terminal's own cursor, which marks how far the host has echoed, is hidden
  (tmux's re-show at the end of each redraw included) and comes back once the
  host catches up; drawn under the predicted one it read as a second cursor
  trailing the first. The overlay also reads the cell size off the screen's
  fractional box rather than its rounded `clientWidth`, so a guess no longer
  drifts off the host's columns towards the right of the line.
- fa906e1: Deleting a line typed ahead of the host no longer bounces at its start. The
  prediction counted the prompt (`❯ `) as text, so Backspaces held past the last
  letter were drawn deleting the prompt too, until the host refused them and the
  line sprang back a second later. The prompt's mark is now left out, and a
  Backspace or Left at the start of the text is predicted to do nothing, as a
  line editor does, instead of dropping the deletions drawn before it.
- 27f034a: The wordmark stands alone: the console's brand row and the auth and public
  pages show "Oppenheimer" without the "Console" suffix. `Wordmark` loses its
  `product` prop, `BrandLogo` is gone (the auth and public chrome draw
  `Wordmark` directly), `AuthLayout` loses its `product` prop, and the
  `common.product` key is gone from the catalogs.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 24d217d: Add host is a dialog in the console.

  - `@oppenheimer/web`: New session's host chip opens the Add host dialog instead
    of navigating to `/onboarding/host`; the dialog owns the Command / Agent
    prompt switch, the panel and a footer that arms on a registered host.
  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-web`: new `hosts` concern with `HostPairingChrome` —
    the token line and the status row the onboarding step and the dialog both
    draw.
  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-consumer`: `useHostPairing` (in `react/hosts.pairing.ts`)
    is the pairing flow both surfaces run; it counts `secondsLeft` rather than
    formatting a clock. `useCurrentPairing`, `usePairingTokens` and `useHosts`'s
    poll are its internals and leave the barrel; the unused `usePairHost` is gone.
  - `@oppenheimer/translations`: new `hosts` namespace for the pairing copy both
    surfaces read, `sessions.new.addHost.*` for the dialog's own words, and
    `common.close`.

- 99219f9: The console mounts the automations overview, runs, run view, editor and sidebar against the consumer's `automations` module.
- c5437b1: The console's rail can be put in the reader's own order by dragging.

  - `@oppenheimer/web`: the rail's items are sortable; a press still opens the
    list, a drag past 5px or Space picks one up, and the order is kept on this
    device. The items are one table, `RAIL` in `features/sessions/lib/rail-order.ts`.
  - `@oppenheimer/design-system-web`: `RailItem` joins a caller's
    `aria-describedby` with its count's, so a `SortableRailItem`'s count is
    still read out beside the drag instructions; a lifted rail item is a
    round pill on the card surface, not the card-shaped box.

- 09cea4c: Effort is each CLI's own levels, per model, instead of five product stops.

  - `@oppenheimer/shared`: each model lists its effort levels and default, each agent spells a level once, and `effortLevelFor` decides what may be recorded.
  - `@oppenheimer/runner`: launch effort is keyed by model and dropped when the model lacks it or the saved launch predates levels.
  - `@oppenheimer/api` / `@oppenheimer/api-client`: sessions, their log and automation revisions record only a level their model offers.
  - `@oppenheimer/web` / `@oppenheimer/translations`: the slider draws the model's levels and sends nothing until moved.
  - `@oppenheimer/design-system-web`: `EffortSlider` and `EffortPicker` take their stops from the caller; `EFFORT_STOPS` is gone.

- c078d0d: `GET /health/capabilities` reports `hosts`, and the console's pairing surfaces mint no token when it is false.
- 2202daa: A session's first task can carry images.

  - `@oppenheimer/shared`: `session.create` carries `images` for runners that name `session.create.images`; `POST /sessions` takes `attachmentIds`.
  - `@oppenheimer/api`: `POST /v1/sessions/attachments` stages an image for the create that names it.
  - `@oppenheimer/runner`: pulls a create's images and names their paths to the agent with the task.
  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-consumer`: `useUploadSessionAttachment`.
  - `@oppenheimer/web`, `@oppenheimer/translations`: the paperclip and paste attach images to the first task.

- 5bd4a8b: New session sets how a session is launched, and `POST /sessions` takes it.

  The route grows a `launch` object — model, permission level, effort — and the
  `prompt` typed into the composer. The launch is folded onto `work_session` so a
  restart can relaunch a session the way it was launched without walking its log.
  The prompt is a log entry and rides `session.create` to the host, where it
  becomes the agent's trailing argument rather than something typed at a running
  terminal — so nothing about the composer waits on the relay, and exactly one of
  the two ends ever writes `prompt.first`. It also names the session, through a
  new `openai-compatible` namer provider that covers Groq, Together, vLLM and a
  local Ollama.

  The agent catalog in `@oppenheimer/shared` grows each agent's models and the
  argv its permission levels, effort stops and first task map to, read off
  claude 2.1.278's and codex-cli 0.155.1's own `--help`.

  **Breaking, `@oppenheimer/frontend-consumer`:** `SessionEntity` was modelling one
  repository, one branch and a `running | idle | stopped` state the control plane
  had stopped sending. It carries `checkouts`, the derived `state` group and the
  stored `lifecycle` now, and `create` takes an idempotency key from its caller.

- d5d310c: An organization's repositories can be reached from the project dialog, and a requested organization install is said rather than dropped.
- 2dc27d2: Plan: a task board, goals and a calendar, the console rail's third item
  (`product/versions/mvp/17-plan.md`).

  - `@oppenheimer/api`: the `tasks` module (tasks, goals, the board's order,
    starting or linking a session, the attach rule) and the `calendar` module
    (personal events, read-only Google Calendar through a port, the sealed
    refresh token under `CALENDAR_TOKEN_KEY`), with the `google_calendar`
    capability, two migrations and the `Task` and `Calendar` rules on `owner`.
  - `@oppenheimer/web`: `/plan` (the board and its dialogs), `/plan/calendar`
    (the month and its layers) and `/plan/calendar/google` (Google's return),
    the Plan rail item, and "Back to task" in a session's status bar.
  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-consumer`: the `tasks` and `calendar` modules and
    their query hooks; `toCreateSessionRequest` is shared by both start paths.
  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-web`: `DateField`, `TimeField` and calendar-day
    helpers in the `i18n` concern.
  - `@oppenheimer/api-client`: regenerated for the new routes.
  - `@oppenheimer/shared`: the task, goal and calendar schemas, the `tasks` and
    `calendar` scopes and the `Task` and `Calendar` subjects.
  - `@oppenheimer/translations`: the `tasks` and `calendar` namespaces,
    `nav.plan`, the date and time field copy and the new toasts.

- 1ad71b4: The create-key dialog takes the per-row permission picker, so a click no longer re-renders every toggle, and the search field keeps the half-typed word while the settled query drives the filter.
- e505b9e: A host gets the repository ready while New session is still being written:
  picking a host and a repository sends `repository.prepare`
  (`POST /v1/sessions/prepare`), and the host clones or fetches it and builds a
  spare worktree, so the create that follows starts in about a second. A first
  clone is shallow and deepened in the background, checkouts write from one
  worker per core, and session branches are cut `--no-track`.
- 0918701: Settings → Profile: the profile card, password, devices and delete account.
- cefbc53: Pull requests: a queue of the watched repositories' open pull requests read live from GitHub (Mine, Review requests, Watching), each in a rule-based lane with what holds it; a briefing with the path to merge, the description, the diff with line comments, and a review that approves and merges in the user's own name; watched repositories; and analytics of the review period against the one before.
- bbacd49: Build the runner ↔ control-plane link so a session can be created and run from the console.

  - API: `relay/` mounts the two sockets of the protocol on the API's own HTTP server — the runner link (`GET /api/v1/relay/runner`, boot assertion as bearer, hello/welcome, heartbeat → host presence, `events.append` → the session log, acked by key) and the browser attach socket (`GET /api/v1/relay/attach`, single-use ticket as the subprotocol, re-checked against the session and the workspace membership). `links/` holds the per-host link registry and the real `SessionDispatchPort`, replacing the pending adapter.
  - Runner: `internal/link` dials out with a per-dial EdDSA boot token, pins the control plane's key fingerprint from `welcome`, reconnects through the ladder with an epoch, streams PTY reads as attachment-id-prefixed frames and reports events with `<runId>:<n>` keys, resending what was not acked. `session.create` maps the structured launch onto the agent's argv through the catalog mirror; the sessions service gained `Stop` and a caller-provided id.
  - Web: `SessionStream` is the real transport over the attach socket, minting a fresh ticket per (re)connect; the terminal shows `offline` while the host holds no link.
  - Credentials: `credentials.token` is answered with a `credentials.grant` sealed to the host's key (Ed25519 → X25519, ephemeral ECDH, HKDF, AES-256-GCM); the runner's git credential helper pulls the token over the link, unseals it and holds it in memory until expiry or `credentials.revoke`. Hello reconciliation re-dispatches a launch the host never carried out and records stopped a session it lost. `attachment.credit` pauses PTY reads at 256 KB in flight; `host.preflight` and `host.update` are handled.
  - Shared: the protocol gains `welcome`, `session.stop`, `session.detach`, `command.failed`, `attachment.closed` and the attach socket's own vocabulary; `CacheService` gains `take()` (`GETDEL`).

- 8fab63d: Add server-evaluated feature flags, wired into the API and the console.

  Flags are declared in code, targeted in the database, evaluated on the server
  and read on every client from one endpoint — the shape Stripe and Revolut
  describe for their own. Ported from the Flama starter.

  - **`@oppenheimer/shared`** gains `feature-flags/`: the `FEATURE_FLAGS` catalog
    (every flag the code may read, with its kind, owner, safe default and — for
    temporary flags — expiry), the pure evaluator (ordered rules, segments,
    semver targeting on the app build, deterministic MurmurHash3 percentage
    splits bucketed by organization), and the Zod schemas for targeting writes.
    Like `agents` and `protocol` it is reached through its own subpaths, not the
    root barrel: `@oppenheimer/shared/feature-flags`, and the Zod-free
    `@oppenheimer/shared/feature-flags/catalog` for the web bundle. A `flags`
    scope group, a `FeatureFlag` subject and a `GET /feature-flags/admin`
    endpoint policy join the catalogs.
  - **`@oppenheimer/api`** gains a `feature-flags` module. Every replica holds
    all targeting in memory and evaluates without I/O, polling a cheap
    fingerprint to stay in sync and keeping its last good snapshot through a
    database blip. `GET /v1/feature-flags` serves the caller's evaluated client
    flags (signed out too); the endpoints under `/v1/feature-flags/admin`,
    `/segments` and `/changes` edit targeting, pull kill switches, manage
    segments, explain an evaluation and read the audit trail, which every change
    lands on through the outbox. `@RequireFlag('key')` gates a route on a flag,
    and token creation is now behind the `api_token_creation` kill switch. New
    error codes `FLAG_001`–`FLAG_007`. Migration `AddFeatureFlags`, every point
    in time `timestamptz`.
  - **`@oppenheimer/api-client`**: the regenerated client carries the feature
    flag operations and DTOs.
  - **`@oppenheimer/frontend-core`**: a `feature-flags` kernel module and
    `useFeatureFlag` / `useFeatureFlagValue` / `useFeatureFlags`, typed by the
    catalog, reading the API rather than PostHog. Flags are prefetched as soon as
    the session is known, persisted with the query cache, and an `experiment`
    flag records a `feature_flag_exposed` event. `OppenheimerApp.create` takes
    `featureFlags: { platform, appVersion }`.

    **Breaking:** feature flags leave the analytics port. `IAnalyticsClient` no
    longer has `getFeatureFlags` / `onFeatureFlags`, `AnalyticsService` no longer
    serves flags, `analyticsKeys.flags` is gone, and `isFlagEnabled` moved to the
    `feature-flags` module. `useFeatureFlag(key)` keeps its name but now takes a
    catalog key and reads the server's answer.

  - **`@oppenheimer/frontend-web`**: the PostHog adapter drops its flag methods
    and switches PostHog's own flag loading off.
  - **`@oppenheimer/translations`**: messages for `FLAG_001`–`FLAG_007`, and the
    control-plane copy for a flags screen (`control.flags`, `nav.featureFlags`).
  - **`@oppenheimer/web`** reports its platform and build when it asks for its
    flags.

  `pnpm check:flags` (in CI) fails on a temporary flag past its expiry date and
  on a flag the catalog declares but no code reads.

- b2fd6a1: A session takes files, not only images: PNG, JPEG, GIF and WebP as before,
  plus PDF and UTF-8 text (plain, Markdown, CSV, JSON, code, logs), pasted,
  dropped or attached to the first task. Every file is judged by its bytes at
  the API and again on the host: executables, archives, scripts with a `#!`
  line, SVG and HTML are refused whatever they are called, and the runner
  names each file itself. A runner announces the wider set with the
  `session.files` capability; an older one is still sent images only.
- 3404cd3: A session's terminal can be shared with a link, to watch or to type, for anyone, any signed-in account or named people (`product/versions/mvp/21-session-share-links.md`).
- 3e6e3dc: Settings → Hosts, as `design/version1/Settings.dc.html` draws it: a page in its own frame, reached from the account menu, listing the workspace's hosts as cards (status, running sessions, OS · vCPU · runner version, connected or last seen) with inline rename, copy ID and remove, and Add a host opening inside the same frame. `HostCard`, `SettingsNav`, `PageHeader`, `RoutineSteps` and the tabbed `CodeBlock` panel now measure as the version-1 export does.
- c237a5f: The console's sidebar reorders by dragging: a project by its header among
  the others (`SortableSidebarProjectGroup`), and a session within its project
  or into another one, which moves it there. The order is kept on the device,
  and the sort menu gains Custom order, its new default.
  `useSortableGroups` tells `onChange` when a drag settles and hands `onMove`
  the value it settled on; a session write stays pending until the session
  lists have refetched.
- 43a17c1: - **frontend-web**: `notifySuccess`, the success toast, which takes a `toasts.*` key.
  - **web**: toasts the writes whose result is easy to miss, and deleting an automation asks through one confirm dialog on the table and on its page.
  - **translations**: success copy under `toasts.*`.
- 487c718: The session terminal keeps the agent's prompt on the pane's last rows.

  In the agent's window Shift+Enter is a newline in the prompt; Ctrl+C copies a selection, and Ctrl+Shift+V pastes.

- 0e5fd26: A session's terminal says what to do when its host is offline, and redials
  when the host is back.

  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-consumer`: `useHostPresence` takes `watching` (polls
    only while it holds) and `select`, so a pane can watch one host on the same
    `hostPresence` poll Settings → Hosts uses.
  - `@oppenheimer/web`: `useTerminal` takes `hostId`; while the link is offline
    it watches that host and redials once a poll answered after the drop finds it
    online. The band under the terminal is the design system's
    `HostLinkChrome`: a banner while the host is away (offline, catching up,
    reconnected) with the time offline and How to fix, which opens the commands
    to copy and the link to Settings → Hosts. Retry now is offered only for a
    blip.
  - `@oppenheimer/translations`: `sessions.session.hostLink.*`; the stream's
    status words other than `closed` go.

- 1a51afc: Serve the built SPAs with gzip, `immutable` caching on hashed assets and a real CSP; prefetch route chunks on intent, issue the session lookup from `<head>`, split vendor chunks per library, and fail `pnpm check:bundle` past a committed budget.
- 45e134b: Files dropped on New session join the composer's attachments, and images
  dropped on a running session's terminal go to the host as a paste does; the
  pane is outlined in blue while the drag is over it.
- bb3c4e8: Starting a session shows the host's steps as the design export draws them.

### Patch Changes

- 1ed003e: The automations pages, the editor, the sidebars and Settings match the
  2026-09-27 frames.

  - `@oppenheimer/design-system-web`: `EditorPage` sits on the recessed canvas;
    `FieldSelect` gains a quiet variant with `FieldSelectGroup` / `FieldSelectRow`;
    `StatusDot` gains a compact density; `SidebarListHead` and
    `SidebarProjectGroup` join the sidebar; `BrandGlyph` takes the theme's ink by
    default.
  - `@oppenheimer/web`: an automation opens on Back and the ordinary page header,
    run history is drawn before the first run, and New session sits on the grey
    canvas with a line saying what sending will do.
  - `@oppenheimer/translations`: copy for the repository count and New session's
    line.

- f02669a: Leaving Plan's board or calendar for another list no longer takes the console
  to its error boundary. Both sidebars are mounted by the shell, which outlives
  those routes, so they read their route's search through a match that is
  allowed to be gone.
- 8875e5b: Deleting an automation from its own page goes back to the list, with the toast
  that says it was deleted, instead of leaving the browser on the page of an
  automation that no longer exists.
- 4c4db57: A deleted session leaves the sidebar once its host has closed it.
- ba9abd0: Timing and retry decisions move to `CORE_CONFIG`
  (`@oppenheimer/frontend-core/config`) and `CONSUMER_CONFIG`
  (`@oppenheimer/frontend-consumer/config`); `createQueryClient`'s `staleTime`
  now defaults to the kernel's. Values are unchanged.
- ab97201: Unused code is removed, and each barrel exports only what the console imports; `pnpm check:unused` holds it there.
- 7ed4e17: The GitHub App install callback is bound to the person who started it.

  - `@oppenheimer/api`: `POST /v1/installations/install-state` (`startInstallation`)
    mints a single-use, 15-minute state bound to the caller and the workspace and
    answers the App's install URL carrying it. `POST /v1/installations` requires
    that state and spends it before GitHub is called; anything else is
    `GITHUB_011`, one code for missing, expired, reused and someone else's.
  - `@oppenheimer/shared`: `connectInstallationSchema` requires `state`
    (`installStateSchema`).
  - `@oppenheimer/api-client`: regenerated.
  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-consumer`: `useStartInstallation`, and
    `InstallationsService.connect` takes `{ githubInstallationId, code, state }`.
  - `@oppenheimer/web`: Connect GitHub and New session's Manage repository access
    mint the state on click; a callback without one is refused on screen and
    never posted. The first-run walk rides as the state's prefix.
  - `@oppenheimer/translations`: `errors.byCode.GITHUB_011`,
    `onboarding.flow.github.unstarted`, `onboarding.flow.github.starting`,
    `sessions.new.repository.manageFailed`.

- 94a700e: - `@oppenheimer/web`: the console's Settings and project glyphs follow the spec in 05.
  - `@oppenheimer/design-system-web`: a `ChipSelect` action takes a `trailing` mark, and `EffortPicker`'s hint describes its slider.
- e717f42: Harden the runner link. PTY bytes are no longer dropped when a queue fills,
  and the runner's writer sends control frames first, then takes attachments in
  turn, so one pane's output no longer delays another pane's echo. Both sides
  now ping every 15 s, a runner the control plane cannot write to is closed
  rather than skipped, and epochs keep rising across API restarts. The
  terminal's transport (`SessionStream`, the resize coalescer, the replay
  stream) moves from `apps/web` into `@oppenheimer/frontend-consumer`, behind
  `SessionsService.openStream` and `useSessionStream`.
- c05c4ff: - The shell frames a page at the route's measure: `staticData.pane` is a size
  of `EditorPageBody`, or `full`. `measure` is gone.
  - `EditorPageBody` takes `size` instead of `wide`; `TaskBoard`'s `gutter` prop
    is gone.
- 473557a: - `EditorPageBody`'s `size` is a measure the export repeats: `status`,
  `composer`, `narrow`, `wide`, `board`, `fluid`. A child opts in to the
  frame's edge with `data-bleed`.
  - The shell frames the page; `EditorPage` paints no ground.
  - `staticData.pane` may be a function of the route's search.
  - The kit adds `PaneBar` and `usePaneDrop`; the design system exports
    `DropOutline`.
- a66c1fe: - `@oppenheimer/frontend-web`: the `hosts` concern is `pairing`, and its components are `PairingChrome`, `PairingToken`, `PairingStatus`, `PairingCopyButtons` and `PairingInstruction`; `AppPending` and `SessionRestoreError` are added.
  - `@oppenheimer/tsconfig`: the app dependency-cruiser rules add `providers-mount-dialogs` and `features-query-through-the-product`.
  - `@oppenheimer/web`: `features/installations/`.
- a0aa978: Plan: Link existing opens a pane under the button in the task's dialog, as the
  design draws it, instead of a second dialog over the first. Each session shows
  its state, repository and age; the task's project's sessions come first under
  its name, Enter links the first match, and the empty line says whether nothing
  matched or every session is already linked.
- c2bb44b: Plan: moving between the board and the calendar from the sidebar no longer
  breaks the screen. The console picks its list from the matched routes rather
  than the address, which moves on while the next route still loads; Plan's two
  sidebars load together, and a swap that still waits draws nothing under the
  nav instead of the previous list. The board's gutter is on its header and
  goals strip, so the columns run to the edge of the page's column.
- 360092b: Plan: the task dialog's title and notes are the design system's labelled
  `Input` and `Textarea`, like the goal dialog's name, rather than borderless
  text styled as a headline.
- 2d84b28: Pull requests read GitHub under its limits and survive a refused part. Each token keeps at most four requests in flight and waits out `Retry-After` and a spent budget, and a long wait is `GITHUB_015` instead of `GITHUB_009` (#247). Analytics reads at most the 150 most recently closed pull requests and says so when there were more. A pull request whose checks GitHub refuses keeps its row with "Checks unavailable", a repository GitHub will not answer is named instead of failing the queue, and a refused permission says what to grant (#244).
- c412130: The Pull requests area reads the repositories you watch, and nothing until you
  watch one. The queue answers with the rows it could fill and fills more over
  the reads that follow, rather than making you wait for every part of every row;
  a pull request it has not read yet is left out instead of shown with a lane and
  a checks state nobody read. Your own pull requests are recognised from a
  personal installation when you have no stored GitHub grant. The review
  period's numbers are kept in the browser's cache, so Analytics draws them at
  once instead of a skeleton, and a quarter's chart is drawn by the week, as the
  artboard draws it. What a read could not show is one notice rather than a
  callout per repository, part and refusal.
- 710df68: Re-measure the web app's first-load budget: 440KB against 435.4KB.

  The budget is the measured size plus headroom, so a drift past it is meant to
  fail — and it has been failing rather than passing. `origin/main` measures
  435.4KB on its own against a 430KB budget, which nothing had re-measured since
  21 September; the check only came up because a change widened CI's scope to
  every package.

  Nothing was shaved here: the entry is the same 435.4KB before and after. What
  moved is the number the check compares it against, with the per-chunk
  breakdown written down beside it and a tighter 4.6KB of headroom than the last
  raise's 9KB, so the next drift fails while it is still one change's worth.

- 6b943c3: Removing a host stops its sessions on the machine, as the remove dialog says.
- b32d3b8: - `@oppenheimer/frontend-core`: `useQuery` and `useQueries` that share entities across refetches.
  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-consumer`: every query hook goes through them.
  - `@oppenheimer/frontend-web`: `createDialogSlot` replaces `ConsoleDialogProvider`, `useConsoleDialog` and `useConsoleList`; `SidebarSearchField` is added.
  - `@oppenheimer/design-system-web`: `useNow` shares one timer per interval; `FieldSelect` no longer reads a ref in render.
  - `@oppenheimer/web`: fewer re-renders in the sidebars and the project dialog.
- 38b511f: Restart brings a session back where it left off, and the stopped pane says so.

  A restart recreated window 0 and started the agent from nothing, replaying the
  first task — so the conversation was lost and the work asked for twice. Now
  that a session names the agent's own conversation, a restart reopens it
  instead: same worktree, same branch, the whole exchange back, and no prompt
  re-sent because the conversation already holds it. Grok joins Claude Code;
  Codex and OpenCode can only resume an id they chose themselves, so they keep
  restarting the way they did.

  The pane that said "This session has stopped. Its work is on its branch" now
  names the branch, says restarting brings the terminal back where it left off,
  and leads with **Restart**. A deleted session has no worktree to return to, so
  it is offered nothing.

- f099524: Auth forms run through React Hook Form: per-field errors inline, and no submit until the whole form parses.
- f099524: Read the root `.env` via Vite's `envDir`; a `.env` inside the app directory is no longer read.
- a566fac: A session's start says when the host is downloading the repository for the
  first time: the clone step carries `download`, and the start pane explains
  the longer wait.
- c2288fb: A new session opens on its agent. The runner starts the agent in place of the
  pane's shell (`tmux respawn-pane`) instead of typing the line that starts it,
  and the console keeps the start's steps on screen until the agent step lands.
- f099524: Take the Better Auth configuration from `@oppenheimer/auth` instead of a local copy.
- 097956a: `@oppenheimer/shared` ships an ESM build in `dist/esm/` for the `import`
  condition beside the CommonJS one, declares its side effects (the two protocol
  modules that register JSON-Schema ids), and collapses its export map to four
  patterns that keep every existing specifier resolving. The web bundle now
  tree-shakes it: the first load drops from 429.3 KB to 376.2 KB gzipped, and
  `apps/web` no longer carries the `optimizeDeps.include` list or the
  `commonjsOptions` override that the CommonJS-only build needed.
- 0e25c03: A session whose agent has not drawn yet says so, instead of showing a white
  rectangle.

  The host reports a session started once tmux holds it, which is before the
  agent inside has painted anything — a few seconds cold, and thirty-five of them
  on a machine under load. The provisioning pane has handed over by then, so the
  reader got an empty pane with a live status dot and no way to tell a slow start
  from a broken session.

  The terminal now covers the grid with "Waiting for the agent" until the first
  byte that would put a glyph on it. Not the first byte: an attachment opens with
  tmux's own preamble — a device-attributes query, the cursor put home, a clear —
  which is bytes that paint nothing, so the cover has to read the escape grammar
  rather than count bytes. A reconnect replays the scrollback, so a session that
  has run before never shows it.

- 4ffcdd6: Plan's columns line up with the header and the goals above them. The board's
  scroller reaches into the page's gutter on its own (`TaskBoard`'s `gutter`),
  the way the artboard draws it, instead of the whole board hanging 32px to the
  left of the page.
- f099524: Follow the `@oppenheimer/config` → `@oppenheimer/tsconfig` rename.
- b9fb2ce: Put the sign-in screens and the first-run steps under one `_auth` layout, with
  the guard on each subtree rather than the shared shell, and fold the
  create-workspace screen at `/onboarding` into the step that already names one:
  `/onboarding` is the door to the walk, and `claimPersonalWorkspace` creates
  when there is no row to name. Every URL is unchanged.
- e647495: The terminal's waiting cover names both reasons the grid is empty.

  It was written for a cold agent, but it also shows while an older session's
  scrollback replays — which on a busy host took several seconds, and telling
  someone their agent is starting when it started an hour ago is just a
  different lie. The reader's question in both cases is whether it is broken, so
  the copy answers that and names both.

- 8d66c87: Pull requests: watched repositories are chips with a remove button under Watching, and Watch a repository is a search over the ones not watched yet, instead of a popover listing every repository with a checkbox.
- ed28ce2: The repository chip holds one repository, and a start refused with `SESS_002` says the host makes sessions with one repository.
- a0e23bd: Search params are Zod schemas (`searchText`, `searchFlag`, `searchPage`) and nuqs is removed; the `one-api-client` rule and the removed `sessions.agents` keys ride along.
- a0fdce4: The terminal's session streams are classes: `AttachSessionStream` for the attach socket and `FakeSessionStream` for the replay, both behind the `SessionStream` interface.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- e209380: Add a CLI and an MCP server, both governed by granular per-credential
  permissions.

  Authorization gains a second layer. Roles say what a _person_ may do; **scopes**
  say what a _credential_ may do on their behalf, and the two are intersected on
  every request. A token can never be minted with more reach than its creator
  has, and revoking someone's role immediately narrows every credential they
  issued.

  - **`@oppenheimer/shared`**: the scope catalog — nine permission groups
    (profile, users, admin, roles, organizations, members, invitations,
    workspaces, tokens), each with a Read and an Edit level backed by the CASL
    rules it authorizes. Helpers for parsing, the write ⇒ read implication, the
    OAuth string form, and `grantableScopes`/`ungrantableScopes`, which enforce
    the "never exceed your creator" rule. Plus `ResourceScope` for per-organization
    narrowing, Zod schemas for token creation, and an `ApiToken` subject with
    own-token permissions on the seeded `user` role.

  - **`@oppenheimer/api`**: a new `api-tokens` DDD module (Better Auth 1.6 no longer
    ships an apiKey plugin). Only a SHA-256 digest of each secret is stored;
    tokens support expiry, IP allowlists and organization scoping, and are revoked
    rather than deleted. `ApiAuthGuard` replaces Better Auth's cookie-only guard
    and accepts a session cookie, an API token or an OAuth access token;
    `ScopesGuard` is registered globally and fails closed, so a route that
    declares no `@RequireScopes` cannot be reached by a token at all. The MCP
    plugin adds OAuth 2.1 discovery, dynamic client registration and a consent
    page. New endpoints: `GET|POST /v1/tokens`, `DELETE /v1/tokens/:id`,
    `GET /v1/tokens/permissions` and `GET /v1/me/credential`.

  - **`@oppenheimer/mcp`** (new): an MCP server exposing 26 tools over stdio and
    Streamable HTTP from one registry. Tools declare the scopes they need and the
    tool list is filtered by the credential's effective scopes, so an agent is
    never shown a capability that would be refused.

  - **`@oppenheimer/cli`** (new): `oppenheimer` — login that trades a session for a scoped
    token, token management with a permission catalog, users/roles/orgs/workspaces
    commands, `--json` output, profiles, and `oppenheimer mcp install` to connect an
    agent.

  - **`@oppenheimer/web`** / **`@oppenheimer/frontend-consumer`**: a
    token-creation screen with a per-resource permission picker (levels you cannot
    grant are disabled) and an OAuth consent screen, backed by new `api-tokens`
    and `organizations` modules with TanStack Query hooks.

  Deploying runs a migration that adds the `api_token` and OAuth tables and grants
  every user permission over their own tokens. `pnpm generate:api-client` no
  longer needs a running database.
