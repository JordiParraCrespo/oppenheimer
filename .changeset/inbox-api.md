The Inbox's API (`product/versions/mvp/28-inbox.md` §4). `GET /v1/bot-approvals?status=pending` reads the workspace's approvals across its bots, newest first, at most 100, each with `botId`, `botName` and `sessionId`, under `bots:read` and `IDX_bot_approval_org_status`. Every move of an approval (raised, decided, expired, run) now raises `BotApprovalChangedDomainEvent`, which the workspace stream sends as `botApproval.changed`.

A new `inbox` module keeps a person's marks on Inbox items in `inbox_mark` (`done`, `low`, `snoozed` until a time, `deleted`; one per person, workspace and occurrence): `GET /v1/inbox/marks` (a snooze that has ended is left out), `PUT /v1/inbox/marks/:itemKey` and an idempotent `DELETE /v1/inbox/marks/:itemKey`, under the new `inbox:read` / `inbox:write` scopes, which, like `profile`, no role backs, and the `inbox` release flag. Each write sends `inboxMark.changed` to that person's streams only. Errors `INBOX_001`–`INBOX_004`.

`@oppenheimer/shared` adds `INBOX_MARKS`, `putInboxMarkSchema`, `inboxItemKeySchema`, `findWorkspaceBotApprovalsSchema` and the two events; the console refetches `['bots', 'approvals', 'pending']` and `['inbox', 'marks']` on them.
