Inbox reports, the API (`product/versions/mvp/29-inbox.md`, "Reports"). The `inbox` module stores its one item, a report, in `inbox_report`: `POST /v1/inbox/reports` takes a title, a body, a source and a link as `multipart/form-data` with up to 4 PNG, JPEG, GIF or WebP pictures of up to 5 MB each under `images`, judged by their bytes and kept in storage; `GET /v1/inbox/reports?status=open|answered` lists the workspace's, newest first, at most 100; `GET /v1/inbox/reports/:id` is what the sender polls for the answer; `GET /v1/inbox/reports/:id/images/:imageId/content` reads a picture. These are under the new `inbox-reports:read` / `inbox-reports:write` scopes, which, like `inbox`, no role backs. `POST /v1/inbox/reports/:id/answer` is under `inbox:write`, so a token holding only the report scopes cannot answer what it asked; a report is answered once. Each send and answer reaches the workspace's streams as `inboxReport.changed`. Errors `INBOX_005`–`INBOX_009`.
