Projects are a saved scope a person creates, and metadata only. `POST /projects` takes a name, the repositories (replaced as a set on `PATCH`, each with a base branch and a default flag) and a default host and agent; the slug comes from the name and never changes. Nothing is derived from a repository any more: `originGithubRepoId` is gone, and a session that names no project is listed in the workspace's **Unassigned** project, which every workspace has and which cannot be renamed or archived (`PROJECTS_008`). `POST /sessions/{id}/move` lists a session under any active project without anything moving on the host: the layout has no project level and a session's branch is `oppenheimer/<session>`. `session.create` no longer carries `projectSlug`. `GET /sessions` gains `githubRepoId`, `agent` and `sort`. The console's New project is a page (`/projects/new`) that returns to New session on the project it made; the project chip starts on Unassigned, and each sidebar row gains a Move to project menu. The translations gain a `projects` namespace. `PROJECTS_004` and `SESSIONS_009` are no longer raised.
