Runner review follow-ups. `systemctl`, `loginctl` and `launchctl` calls now time out after a minute. `runner sessions` refreshes the whole host in one pass. An event batch the link took but never acked is sent again after a minute, together with every batch made after it, in order. The link has one frame cap, `LINK_MAX_FRAME_BYTES` (512 KiB), shared by the control plane and the generated `MaxFrameBytes`: the runner reads nothing larger and never sends anything larger. When the session list in `hello` and `heartbeat` does not fit, it is sent compact, and only past about 2,800 sessions is it truncated.
