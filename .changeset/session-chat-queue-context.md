A session's chat queues what is written while the agent works and shows the room left. A message sent mid-turn waits on the composer (`SessionChat.post`), to be sent now, edited or dropped, and goes on its own when the turn ends, one at a time. Beside the model, the context meter opens to the context in tokens (with Compact) and the plan's 5-hour and weekly limits with their resets.

The limits are Claude Code's own: the runner launches a session's Claude Code with `--settings` naming `runner statusline` as its status line, which keeps what the CLI hands it (`context_window`, `rate_limits`) by conversation and still draws the person's own status line, or `ctx · 5h · 7d` when they have none; the chat follower sends the latest as an `oppenheimer.status` entry (`ChatState.status`). The runner also keeps each answer's token counts (`message.usage`), so the context is counted off the transcript until the status line says. `ComposerContextMeter` forwards a button's props, so it can be a popover's trigger, and the composer's field is no longer remounted when something appears on top of it.
