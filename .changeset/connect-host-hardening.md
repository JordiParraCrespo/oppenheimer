Connecting a host is hardened. An unpaired host is refused a link and stops dialling. The pairing-token cap holds under concurrent mints, and `POST /v1/hosts/pairing` takes `replaces` to retire the token on screen in the same write. The owner is emailed when a machine pairs. The agent prompt is a short template around the install command. `runner uninstall --force` keeps the pairing when a session cannot be ended, and a re-run of the installer restarts the systemd unit on the new release.
